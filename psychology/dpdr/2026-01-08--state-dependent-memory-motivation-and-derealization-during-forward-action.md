# Note: State-Dependent Memory, Motivation, and Derealization During Forward Action

Date: 2026-01-08

Durable reference note capturing a real-time mechanism: derealization, aversion, and motivation flips co-occur with state-dependent access to the self-state that created prior work; restoring contextual memory rapidly restores pull-based motivation and optimism.

## Core Observation

When preparing to take a meaningful next step (e.g., locating prior work to advance a project), derealization, aversion, and doubt about the value and feasibility of the step appeared. This was not due to the step itself, but due to a temporary loss of access to the self-state that originally created the work.

The moment I remembered where I had used this method before, which projects it applied to, and where documentation likely lived, internal state shifted immediately:

- optimism returned
- motivation changed from coercive to pull-based
- the step felt meaningful and safe again

This happened automatically, without self-talk or effort.

## Mechanism Identified: State-Dependent Access

This demonstrates state-dependent memory and state-dependent motivation.

The self-state that creates high-quality work contains:

- confidence in competence
- trust in continuity over time
- expectation that action leads to reinforcement, not shame

When derealized, I am temporarily dissociated from that self-state, making:

- relevant memories harder to access
- past competence feel unreal
- next steps feel disproportionately difficult or risky

The issue is not lost information — it is loss of access to the identity context that encoded the information.

## Why Motivation Returned as “Pull”

Once partial memory access returned, motivation shifted from:

- push (identity stabilization, threat reduction)

to:

- pull (curiosity, alignment, forward continuity)

This confirms:

- push-based motivation = threat/self-protection
- pull-based motivation = confidence and trust in self-continuity

Pull emerges when the brain predicts action will reinforce competence rather than expose shame.

## Oscillation Explained

The phasing in and out of derealization reflects competition between two self-models:

1) Old threat-based model

- expects blame, collapse, or moral failure
- treats uncertainty as danger

2) New confidence-based model

- expects continuity and solvability
- treats uncertainty as logistical, not moral

As memory access improves, the new model gains dominance. As imagined difficulty appears, the old model attempts to reassert.

This oscillation is not instability — it is a gate being contested, not closed.

## Positive Feedback Loop Identified

A critical reversal is now active:

**Access → Trust → Motivation → More Access**

Instead of the old loop:

**Uncertainty → Threat → Derealization → Less Access**

This explains why remembering contextual details immediately reduced aversion and restored optimism.


---

## Practical Implication

When derealization appears before a planned step, the correct response is not force, optimization, or reassurance, but:

- re-accessing contextual memory
- recalling who I was when the work was created
- letting continuity re-establish itself naturally

Trying to “lock in” the feeling or rush action reactivates threat-based stabilization and should be avoided.

## Key Insight

This is not just understanding a mechanism — it is observing it operate in real time.

The self-model is beginning to remain continuous across time and action, which is why this feels fundamentally different from prior breakthroughs.
