# DP/DR Trigger Identified: Self-Review as the Switch

Summary: Identifies the precise ignition point for DP/DR as the mid-action flip from action to self-review (evaluation mode), which activates a scapegoating-conditioned threat association; the corrective rule is to defer self-review until after execution so competence can run without commentary and the nervous system can update safety through action.

## Core realization

The exact moment DP/DR activates is when attention flips from action to self-review.


---

## Mechanism (step-by-step)

### 1) Context switch

Action mode → evaluation mode  
“I am doing” → “I am being assessed”

### 2) Self becomes object

The self enters awareness as something to be judged rather than the agent doing the task.
This activates self-referential processing (DMN) tied to worth, meaning, and identity.

### 3) Threat association

Historically, self-review was paired with:

- scapegoating
- blame
- moral condemnation
- abandonment

Nervous system learned: self-review = danger.

### 4) Protective response

DP/DR emerges as a learned emergency exit:

- detachment prevents further harm
- unreality blocks moral injury


---

## Key insight

DP/DR is not random, not a failure, and not a lack of confidence.
It is a conditioned protective disengagement triggered specifically by mid-action self-evaluation.


---

## Why motivation finally worked today

- action was allowed to proceed without self-review
- the self remained implicit instead of being evaluated
- value stayed external (task, environment), not internal (identity)
- confidence was enacted, not assessed


---

## Critical rule extracted

> Self-review during action is destabilizing.  
> Reflection belongs after outcomes, not during execution.


---

## Implication for future work

- bypass or delay self-review while acting
- let competence express itself without commentary
- use reflection only once safety and completion are established


---

## Why this matters

This identifies the upstream control lever of DP/DR—the moment of ignition, not the symptom.
Managing when self-review occurs restores agency, motivation, and cognitive access without forcing reassurance.

Status: ultra-high value insight. Foundational. Reusable across tasks, projects, and future stressors.
