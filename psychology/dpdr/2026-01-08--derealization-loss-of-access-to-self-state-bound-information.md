# Note: Derealization → Loss of Access to Self-State–Bound Information

Date: 2026-01-08

Clinical note capturing a state-dependent mechanism: derealization before forward action gates access to the self-state that created the plan/resources, creating an illusion of lost work and triggering compulsive system repair. Corrective action is state re-entry via contextual cues (safety precedes recall).

## Core Observation

When I am about to take a planned forward action and derealization appears, I become dissociated from the self-state that originally created the plan, resources, and structure for that action.

This dissociation is not random — it is state-dependent and threat-triggered.


---

## Mechanism

The self-state that created the materials (notes, systems, stored resources) was:

- confident
- oriented toward progress
- not morally threatened

When moral scrupulosity or fear of blame activates, a different self-model becomes salient.

That self-model does not have full access to:

- memory of where things were stored
- memory of why storage decisions made sense
- procedural confidence about retrieval

This creates the illusion that:

- resources may be lost
- past work may be inaccessible
- I “can’t find” what I previously organized well


---

## Key Insight

The information is not missing.
Access to it is state-gated.

The derealized state disrupts:

- retrieval cues
- contextual memory
- trust in past competence

This reinforces avoidance by making the next step feel:

- more difficult than it is
- more risky than it is
- morally charged (“If I can’t find it, it means I failed”)


---

## Why This Feels Urgent

The brain interprets this access disruption as evidence of:

- past negligence
- a system failure
- a reason to stop and “fix everything first”

This escalates into compulsive system optimization as a moral repair attempt.


---

## Corrective Strategy (Critical)

Instead of forcing action or re-optimizing systems:

Re-enter the original self-state contextually by:

- recalling what I was working on at the time
- remembering the environment, tools, and intentions present
- letting retrieval happen passively, not coercively

This works because:

- memory access improves when contextual cues match the encoding state
- confidence restores access faster than effort
- safety precedes recall


---

## Reframe

> “I am not failing to remember.  
> I am temporarily not in the self-state that remembers.”

The task is not to fix the system.
The task is to reconnect to the self that built it.


---

## Behavioral Rule

When derealization + avoidance + “I can’t find my notes” appear together:

- do not reorganize
- do not optimize
- do not conclude loss or incompetence

Instead:

- pause
- recall context
- allow access to return


---

## Status

This explains:

- sudden memory inaccessibility before action
- inflated fear of lost work
- compulsive system repair urges
- action paralysis despite prior clarity

Recognizing this restores forward momentum without reinforcing scrupulosity.

If you want, next we can:

- turn this into a one-line interrupt for instant use, or
- integrate it into the YouTube MVP execution checklist so this state switch can’t derail progress again
