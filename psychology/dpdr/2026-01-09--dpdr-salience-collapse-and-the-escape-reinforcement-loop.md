Summary: Frames DP/DR as a salience-regulating state that temporarily constrains accessible cognition (working memory/search space), producing real performance dips that can be misread as trait inadequacy and reinforce escape/avoidance—especially when scapegoating historically punished effort under dysregulation; the loop breaks through continued action and post-state success without moral consequence.

## Core insight

The presence of DP/DR does not merely produce emotional detachment or unreality—it actively degrades cognitive accessibility by constraining salience. This temporary reduction in accessible cognitive resources creates real, observable performance impairment, which then reinforces the impulse to escape. The escape impulse is therefore not avoidance of effort, but avoidance of self-model confirmation under degraded conditions.

## 1) DP/DR as a salience-regulating state (not a skill deficit)

When DP/DR is active, the negative self-model governs perception. This model:

- narrows what information enters working memory
- suppresses access to memories of competence and prior success
- reduces associative breadth (creativity, synthesis, insight)
- prioritizes threat monitoring over exploration

As a result, problem-solving capacity genuinely drops, not because intelligence is reduced, but because the search space is artificially constrained.

This is a state-dependent limitation, not a trait-level one.

## 2) Why performance decreases feel “convincing”

Because the impairment is real, the system concludes:

> “I cannot function effectively like this.”

This conclusion feels accurate, because performance is impaired in the moment. However, the causal direction is misattributed.

The true sequence is:

Negative self-model → salience restriction → temporary cognitive impairment

Not:

Cognitive impairment → evidence of personal inadequacy


---

## 3) The escape impulse as a protective strategy

The escape impulse emerges as a self-protective maneuver:

- continuing to work while impaired risks confirming negative core beliefs
- reduced performance becomes interpretable as moral or personal failure
- escape prevents further “evidence” from being generated

Thus, escape is not about comfort—it is about preventing identity damage under hostile attribution conditions.


---

## 4) Historical reinforcement through scapegoating

In environments where:

- impaired performance was blamed rather than contextualized
- effort during dysregulation was still judged as failure
- no post-state recovery or success was acknowledged

…the system learned:

> “Pushing through while dysregulated only makes things worse.”

This conditioned DP/DR to be followed by avoidance, because avoidance was the only way to limit downstream harm to the self-model.


---

## 5) The self-reinforcing loop

The full loop operates as follows:

1. DP/DR activates
2. salience narrows → cognitive access decreases
3. performance dips
4. dip is interpreted as confirmation of inadequacy
5. escape impulse intensifies
6. avoidance reinforces belief that continuation is dangerous

This loop persists until post-DP/DR success without punishment is experienced.


---

## 6) Why this loop is breaking now

The critical interrupt is continued action without moral consequence:

- performance returns after DP/DR passes
- no authority reframes effort as failure
- competence is observed after the state resolves

This teaches the system:

> “Temporary impairment does not equal permanent limitation.”

And more importantly:

> “I remain intact even when salience collapses.”


---

## 7) Key reframe to retain

When DP/DR is present and cognition feels impaired, the correct interpretation is:

> “This is a temporary salience collapse caused by an outdated self-model—not evidence of diminished ability.”

The escape impulse is understandable—but no longer necessary.


---

## Summary statement

DP/DR reduces cognitive functioning by restricting salience, not by reducing intelligence. This temporary impairment historically reinforced avoidance because effort under those conditions was punished or scapegoated. As that reinforcement disappears, the escape impulse loses its function—and DP/DR loses its authority.
