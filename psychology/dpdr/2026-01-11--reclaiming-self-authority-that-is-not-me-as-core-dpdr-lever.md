Summary: Defines “That is not me” as a high-leverage DP/DR intervention that revokes epistemic authority from judgmental frames/models that try to capture identity; it breaks identification, denies jurisdiction, and reasserts authorship without debate, reassurance, or affect change.


---

## Core function

The statement “That is not me” is a precise, high-leverage intervention for DP/DR rooted in shame and scapegoating. It revokes epistemic authority from judgmental representations (imagined observers, memories, self-judging frames) that incorrectly claim identity status.


---

## Mechanism (what it actually does)

1. **Breaks identification** — stops the collapse of representation → identity.
2. **Revokes jurisdiction** — denies the frame any authority to define reality.
3. **Reasserts authorship** — restores first-person, inside-out self-definition.


---

## Why it works better than reassurance or reframing

Reassurance argues inside the judgmental frame.

“That is not me” dissolves the frame by denying it standing.

No debate, no correction—finality.


---

## How to use (critical)

- Use only when identity capture occurs (DP/DR spike, flatness, “this defines me”).
- Tone: flat, factual, final (not emotional or defensive).
- Say it once; do not elaborate. Repeat only if the frame reappears.


---

## Optional precision variants

- “That is a model, not me.”
- “That is an image, not an identity.”


---

## What it is / is not

Is:

- fierce self-compassion
- dominance via authority assignment

Is not:

- avoidance
- denial
- suppression
- anti-growth


---

## Bottom line

This statement directly corrects the root DP/DR failure mode—misassigned authority. It restores self-definition without needing positive affect, certainty, or reassurance.
