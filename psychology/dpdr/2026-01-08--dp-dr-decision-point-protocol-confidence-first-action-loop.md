# Title: DP/DR Decision-Point Protocol — Confidence-First Action Loop

Date: 2026-01-08

Purpose

This note defines a repeatable, values-aligned way to handle DP/DR decision points. It converts moments of uncertainty, derealization, and fear-of-finality into forward motion without identity collapse.


---

## Core Insight

At DP/DR decision points, the threat is not the task — it is the false belief of finality (“If I choose wrong, my worth is damaged and unrecoverable”).

The antidote is confidence expressed through bounded action, not reassurance-seeking.


---

## The Protocol (Step-by-Step)

### 1) Name the State (Fast)

Identify: “This is a DP/DR decision point.”

Translation: perception of difficulty/finality is inflated; self-trust is temporarily offline.


### 2) Anchor to Objective Relevance

Ask one question only:

“Is this item realistically relevant to my current objective?”

If yes, proceed with bounds.

If no, defer without guilt.


### 3) Choose the Lowest-Friction Valid Path

Start with sources most likely to succeed quickly (known docs, dates, tools).

Avoid high-cost searches first (deep chat archaeology, system overhauls).


### 4) Time-Bound the Search

Predefine a limit (e.g., 15–30 minutes).

This prevents compulsive looping and identity collapse.


### 5) Declare a Non-Shaming Fallback

If not found within bounds:

- switch modes intentionally (recreate, rest, or pivot)
- explicitly reject the idea that stopping equals failure


### 6) Act as if Recovery Is Guaranteed

Hold this stance during action:

“Even if this fails, I will rebuild or reroute successfully.”

This collapses the fear of finality.


### 7) Close with Ownership

Internally affirm:

“I chose action aligned with confidence, not coercion.”

Outcome does not define self-worth.

## What This Prevents

- compulsive reassurance-seeking
- over-optimization before action
- moral scrupulosity (“I must prevent future harm”)
- avoidance framed as preparation
- identity collapse tied to task outcomes


---

## Why This Works

- behavioral proof > cognitive reassurance
- confidence grows from doing, not from certainty
- time-bounding neutralizes OCD/DPDR escalation
- fallbacks preserve self-integrity
- repetition retrains the self-model toward trust


---

## Reframe to Remember

> “I don’t need certainty to act.
> I need confidence that I can recover.”

This protocol should be applied every time a DP/DR decision point appears.
