# Decision Integrity Artifact — Counter-Norm Choices and Confidence Weighting
Date: 2026-01-05
Tags: decision integrity, social norms, confidence weighting, self-trust, hypervigilance, values, moral reasoning
Summary: When value-aligned decisions violate norms, post-hoc doubt typically reflects anticipated social punishment rather than moral error; preserve self-trust by deliberately increasing confidence weight on the original value-based reasoning.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> When I make a decision that aligns with my values but violates common social norms, any subsequent hypervigilance reflects social threat, not moral error; these moments require deliberate confidence-weighting of my value-aligned reasoning to preserve self-trust.

## Purpose

This note formalizes how to respond when:
- a decision is made using sound moral and risk calculus
- the decision contradicts common or default social judgments
- a delayed threat response appears as doubt or hypervigilance

It exists to prevent **social norm pressure** from masquerading as moral uncertainty.

---

## Core Observation

Sequence observed:

1. A decision is made deliberately
   - grounded in logic
   - aligned with personal values
   - judged internally as non-harmful

2. After the fact, a threat response appears:
   - “Was that irresponsible?”
   - “Was that wrong?”
   - “Would others judge this negatively?”

3. The trigger is not internal misalignment.
   The trigger is **anticipation of external moral judgment**.

## Mechanistic Explanation

### Source of the Threat Response

The hypervigilance arises because:
- many people default to socially inherited heuristics
- deviation from those heuristics is often punished
- the nervous system learned to treat deviation as danger

Therefore:

> **The doubt is about social safety, not ethical correctness.**

---

### Why These Moments Are Special

These decisions are uniquely important because:
- they represent autonomous value execution
- they reinforce internal authority
- they move identity away from external validation

They are *exactly* the moments where self-trust is being exercised.

## Required Response (Explicit Rule)

When doubt follows a value-aligned, counter-norm decision:

1. Do **not** re-open the original decision calculus
2. Do **not** seek external validation
3. Do **not** interpret the doubt as a signal of error

Instead:

> **Increase confidence weighting on the original value alignment.**

Specifically:
- restate why the decision fits your values
- acknowledge that social disapproval was anticipated
- confirm that harm was not created
- recognize the threat as normative, not moral

---

## Why Confidence Weighting Is Necessary Here

Without deliberate confidence weighting:
- uncertainty persists
- self-trust erodes
- future autonomous decisions become harder

With confidence weighting:
- uncertainty collapses
- internal authority strengthens
- future deviation becomes safer

This directly improves long-term self-trust stability.

## High-Compression Summary

Doubt following a value-aligned but counter-norm decision reflects social threat, not moral failure; resolving it requires reinforcing confidence in one’s own value-based reasoning rather than revisiting the decision.

## Status

This artifact defines a **self-trust preservation rule** for autonomous decision-making under social pressure and should be applied whenever norm deviation triggers doubt.
