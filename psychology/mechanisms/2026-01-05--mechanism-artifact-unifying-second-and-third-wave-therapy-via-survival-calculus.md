Tags: therapy, CBT, ACT, DBT, mindfulness, cognitive reframing, survival calculus, confidence weighting
Summary: Unifies second-wave reframing and third-wave mindfulness/choice as different interventions on the same system—reweighting threat and confidence—clarifying when belief/awareness reduce suffering vs fail without accurate risk correction.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> The survival-calculus model unifies second-wave cognitive reframing and third-wave mindfulness/choice by explaining both as mechanisms for reweighting threat and confidence, clarifying when chosen belief and awareness reduce suffering and when they fail without accurate risk correction.

## Purpose

This artifact formalizes how the models being developed integrate and explain the core mechanisms behind:
- second-wave cognitive therapy (CBT, reframing)
- third-wave approaches (mindfulness, ACT, DBT, metacognitive awareness)

It shows that these are not competing philosophies but **different access points to the same underlying system**.

---

## Core Unification Principle

All effective therapeutic change operates by modifying:
- **survival calculus**
- **confidence weighting**
- **threat classification**

Second- and third-wave approaches differ primarily in **where they intervene**, not in what they ultimately change.

---

## Second-Wave Therapies (Cognitive Reframing)

Second-wave approaches focus on:
- identifying distorted beliefs
- challenging interpretations
- replacing maladaptive thoughts

Mechanistically, this works when:
- reframing successfully **corrects an inflated survival threat**
- new interpretations are credible enough to reweight confidence

Failure occurs when:
- reframing is applied without addressing real threat
- belief change is attempted while survival calculus remains unconvinced

---

## Third-Wave Therapies (Mindfulness, Choice, Acceptance)

Third-wave approaches emphasize:
- observing thoughts without fusion
- allowing internal states
- choosing values-based action

Mechanistically, this works by:
- reducing automatic threat responses
- decoupling emotion from immediate action
- creating space for recalibration

Failure occurs when:
- awareness is used to tolerate genuine danger
- acceptance is substituted for risk correction
- choice is framed without recalculating survival impact

---

## How the Survival-Calculus Model Integrates Both

The current model shows that:

- **Mindfulness** reduces false positives in threat detection  
- **Chosen belief** works when it accurately updates survival calculus  
- **Cognitive reframing** is effective when it closes real risk loops  
- **Acceptance** is stabilizing when threat is historical, not current  

All succeed only insofar as they **correct or contextualize survival risk**.

---

## Why This Integration Matters

Without this unifying model:
- second-wave methods feel forceful or invalidating
- third-wave methods feel passive or permissive

With the model:
- reframing becomes precise instead of argumentative
- mindfulness becomes diagnostic instead of avoidant
- choice becomes credible instead of aspirational

The therapies are no longer ideological — they are **instrumental**.

---

## Relationship to Chosen Belief

Chosen belief is not denial.

It is:
- the deliberate placement of confidence *after* survival calculus is assessed

This explains why:
- belief alone sometimes works
- belief alone often fails
- mindfulness can precede belief change
- reframing must be grounded in risk accuracy

---

## High-Compression Summary

Second- and third-wave therapies converge mechanistically as methods for recalibrating survival calculus and confidence weighting; their apparent differences reflect intervention timing, not fundamental disagreement.

## Status

This artifact defines a unifying explanatory framework linking cognitive reframing, mindfulness, and chosen belief through survival-calculus dynamics.

No synthesis required.
