# Mechanism Artifact — Proof-Seeking During Consolidation Increases Distance Rather Than Certainty

Summary: During consolidation, trying to re-prove insights keeps them in active arbitration and increases felt distance; non-interference and allowing space support stabilization and durability.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> Attempting to re-prove the reality of insights during consolidation paradoxically increases felt distance from them, because proof-seeking keeps material in active arbitration instead of allowing it to settle into stable memory.

## Purpose

This artifact preserves a critical self-regulation insight:
that the urge to *confirm reality* during fatigue or consolidation is not protective in this phase, but counterproductive.

It prevents misinterpreting distance as loss or invalidation.

---

## Core Principle

Reality does not become stable through continuous verification.

Reality becomes stable through **release from arbitration**.

Consolidation requires reduced salience, not increased scrutiny.

---

## Mechanism Breakdown

### 1. Proof-Seeking as a Legacy Safety Behavior

The impulse to “make sure it’s real” originated as a protection against:
- erasure
- minimization
- gaslighting
- loss of epistemic ground

In active threat contexts, this behavior was adaptive.

---

### 2. Phase Mismatch During Consolidation

During consolidation:
- the brain intentionally lowers salience
- emotional vividness is reduced
- distance increases to allow pattern integration

When proof-seeking is activated in this phase:
- the brain reopens arbitration
- salience is forced back up
- integration is interrupted

The result is **felt distance**, not reassurance.

---

### 3. Why Distance Increases the More You Check

Each attempt to re-verify:
- treats the insight as unstable
- reclassifies it as “still under evaluation”
- prevents it from being marked as settled

This creates a loop:
> uncertainty → proof attempt → increased distance → more proof attempt

The loop is exhausting and unnecessary.

---

### 4. Correct Classification of Distance

The correct interpretation of distance during consolidation is:

> “My brain is creating space so this can become permanent.”

Distance here is **a feature**, not a failure.

---

## Correct Practice (What to Do Instead)

The appropriate response during consolidation is:
- **non-interference**
- allowing partial uncertainty
- trusting that integration does not require vigilance

The skill being practiced is **restraint**, not insight generation.

---

## Survival Calculus Correction

Continuing to prove reality when tired:
- increases energy cost
- delays stabilization
- falsely signals ongoing threat

Allowing distance:
- reduces cost
- increases durability
- signals safety

From a survivability standpoint, release is optimal.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Trying to re-prove insight reality during consolidation keeps it unstable and increases felt distance; allowing space enables the brain to stabilize meaning without further effort.

## Status

This artifact records a **phase-specific self-regulation rule** that prevents unnecessary effort and protects integration during consolidation.

No synthesis required.
