# Mechanism Artifact — Neglect as High-Risk Abandonment Under Dependency
Date: 2026-01-05
Tags: neglect, abandonment, dependency, survival risk, leverage, moral judgment, abuse
Summary: Frames neglect as abusive risk externalization: a dependent person is left to carry abandonment risk precisely when support is needed, often while still subject to others’ leverage and moral judgment.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> Neglect is profoundly abusive because it exposes a dependent individual to unfair abandonment precisely when support is most needed, forcing them to carry survival risk alone while remaining subject to others’ leverage and moral judgment.

## Purpose

This artifact formalizes why neglect causes deep, persistent harm even in the absence of overt hostility, and why its effects are especially severe when the individual remains dependent or exposed to relational leverage.

It reframes neglect as **risk externalization**, not absence of care.

---

## Core Principle

Abuse is not defined solely by intrusion or aggression.

It is defined by:
> **Who is forced to carry survival risk, and when.**

Neglect is abusive because it transfers risk **downward**, onto the most vulnerable party, without warning or consent.

---

## Mechanism Breakdown

### 1. Dependency Without Protection

In the described dynamic:
- essential needs (emotional, relational, stabilizing) are unmet
- support is unreliable or withdrawn
- dependency remains structurally intact

This creates the condition:
> High need + low support = maximum vulnerability.

---

### 2. Unfair Abandonment Risk

Neglect introduces the constant possibility of:
- being left alone during crisis
- losing support when least able to compensate
- having needs minimized or ignored

This abandonment is:
- unpredictable
- undeserved
- unrelated to behavior quality

The risk is ambient and chronic.

---

### 3. Leverage Without Responsibility

Critically, neglect often coexists with:
- continued authority
- moral judgment
- expectation of compliance or performance

This produces a double bind:
- needs are not met
- but failure to function is still blamed

Leverage is retained; care is not.

---

### 4. Survival Calculus Impact

The nervous system learns:
- safety cannot be assumed
- support is conditional or absent
- failure may result in isolation

This forces:
- hyper-independence
- premature self-sufficiency
- chronic vigilance
- suppression of need

None of these are choices; they are adaptations.

---

## Why Neglect Is Especially Damaging

Neglect:
- offers no clear event to process
- provides no closure
- denies the reality of need
- invalidates suffering while creating it

The individual is harmed **and** deprived of acknowledgment.

---

## Relationship to Exhaustion and DP/DR

This mechanism contributes directly to:
- constant background threat
- fear of abandonment during vulnerability
- high-cost self-regulation
- dissociation when needs cannot be safely expressed

The system adapts by minimizing need rather than expecting care.

---

## Critical Reframe

The correct interpretation is not:
> “I needed too much.”

But:
> “I was exposed to unacceptable risk while dependent, and the cost was placed on me.”

That is abuse by definition.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Neglect is abusive because it forces a dependent individual to bear unfair abandonment risk during moments of need while remaining subject to others’ leverage and judgment.

---

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> Neglect is profoundly abusive because it exposes a dependent individual to unfair abandonment precisely when support is most needed, forcing them to carry survival risk alone while remaining subject to others’ leverage and moral judgment.

---

## Status

This artifact defines neglect as a high-risk survival condition rather than passive absence of care, preserving epistemic clarity and preventing self-blame.

No synthesis required.
