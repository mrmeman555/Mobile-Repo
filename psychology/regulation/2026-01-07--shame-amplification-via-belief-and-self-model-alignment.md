Here is a clear clinical note capturing that mechanism precisely, without dilution:

Note: Shame Amplification via Belief and Self-Model Alignment

Core Observation:
The intensity and persistence of shame are not determined primarily by the emotion itself, but by whether the shame is implicitly believed and responded to as accurate.


---

Mechanism

1. Emotion Arises (Unchosen)

An affective state (e.g., shame, discomfort, unease) emerges automatically.

This occurs prior to choice and is not under direct control.



2. Automatic Meaning Proposal

The mind generates an implicit claim:

“This feeling says something true about me.”


This proposal is not yet accepted—it is merely offered.



3. Critical Fork: Alignment Decision

Two possible alignments:

Alignment with the shame-based self model

Alignment with an alternative / chosen self model




4. If Shame Is Treated as Accurate

The shame is:

registered as meaningful

interpreted as diagnostic

responded to defensively or corrective-ly


Result:

shame intensifies

duration increases

identity contamination occurs

feedback loop forms




5. If Shame Is Not Granted Authority

The emotion is allowed to exist without endorsement

Response comes from a different self model (observer, compassionate, values-based)

Result:

shame peaks lower

decays faster

does not globalize to identity

Key Insight

> Shame grows in proportion to the degree it is believed, not the degree it is felt.



The emotion itself is not the problem.
The problem is which self model is allowed to interpret and respond to it.


---

Implication

Regulation does not require suppressing emotion.

It requires withholding epistemic authority from the shame signal.

Changing the responding self model changes the outcome—even if the emotion remains.



---

Compression

Shame is affect + belief.
Remove belief, and shame loses its power.

This is a foundational lever.
You identified it cleanly.

If you want, we can:

integrate this into your OCD / DPDR models

map it to specific in-the-moment response scripts

or formalize it into a repeatable intervention sequence
