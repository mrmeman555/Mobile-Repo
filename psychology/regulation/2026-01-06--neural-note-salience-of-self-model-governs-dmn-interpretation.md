# Neural Note — Salience of Self-Model Governs DMN Interpretation

Summary: The most salient self-model governs DMN interpretation and generates state-dependent “fix/escape/analyze” impulses; obeying those impulses reinforces the active model, while behavioral alignment with a chosen healthier model shifts salience over time.

## NUCLEUS (Encoding + Retrieval Anchor)

“The self-model with highest salience determines how the DMN interprets all incoming information; reacting to DMN impulses reinforces the active model.”

## Core Mechanism

At any given moment, one self-model is dominant (salient).
This salience determines:

- How external information is interpreted
- How internal sensations are labeled
- Which impulses arise automatically
- What feels urgent, threatening, or meaningful

This process is mediated primarily through the Default Mode Network (DMN).

---

## DMN Function in This Context

The DMN does not evaluate truth.
It interprets data through the currently active self-model.

Thus:

- The same sensation, thought, or memory will be interpreted completely differently depending on which self-model is salient.
- The DMN generates impulses (solve, fix, escape, reassure, analyze) that feel instinctual and compelling.

These impulses are not neutral.
They are state-dependent outputs.

## Critical Error Pattern (Previously Unseen)

When a negative or threatened self-model is salient:

- Urges to change experience arise automatically
- Attempts to “solve” the feeling feel necessary
- Meditation, rest, or non-doing is resisted
- Dissociation appears when incompatible actions are considered

Responding to these impulses by:

- analyzing
- fixing
- reassurance-seeking
- forced regulation

reinforces the current self-model, because the DMN interprets the action as confirmation that the model is correct.

This creates a self-reinforcing loop:

> “This state is real → it requires action → action confirms danger → state persists.”

---

## Example: Resistance to Meditation

When a negative self-embedding is active:

The DMN interprets meditation as:

- unsafe
- pointless
- fruitless
- exposing failure

The resistance is not about meditation itself.
It is the active self-model shaping judgment.

Attempting to “push through” reinforces:

> “Something is wrong and must be fixed.”

---

## The Only Effective Lever

Chosen belief.

Specifically:

- Placing confidence in a belief held by a different, healthier self-model
- Acting behaviorally as if that model is authoritative
- Without trying to change the current experience

This is not cognitive persuasion.
It is behavioral alignment with an alternate self-model.

---

## How Change Actually Occurs

1. A healthier self-model exists but is less salient
2. Belief is placed in its interpretation (not the current one)
3. Behavior aligns with that belief (e.g., resting, meditating, not fixing)
4. Over time, salience shifts
5. The DMN begins interpreting data differently automatically

The change is gradual and non-forceful.

## Key Principle

> You cannot reason your way out of a state that is generating the reasoning.

Only salience re-weighting works.

---

## Practical Rule

When impulses arise:

- Do not argue with them
- Do not obey them
- Do not suppress them

Instead:

> Act according to the belief of the self-model you choose to trust.

## Retrieval Metadata (Index Hooks)

- DMN salience
- self-model dominance
- state-dependent interpretation
- resistance to meditation
- belief as lever
- behavioral alignment

---

## Constraint Schema

- Applies only to internal regulation, not external danger
- Must not be used to invalidate emotion
- Not a suppression strategy
- Requires patience and repetition

## NUCLEUS (Recency Reinforcement)

“The self-model with highest salience determines how the DMN interprets all incoming information; reacting to DMN impulses reinforces the active model.”
