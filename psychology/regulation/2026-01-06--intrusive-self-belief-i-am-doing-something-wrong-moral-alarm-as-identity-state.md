Summary: Distinguishes an identity-level intrusive self-belief (“I am doing something wrong”) from thoughts/emotions; it triggers scanning without evidence, and is best neutralized by categorical reclassification rather than investigation.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> The experience is not just a feeling or thought — it is an **intrusive self-belief**: a deeply felt identity-level conviction that “I am doing something wrong.” This belief activates scanning and vigilance even in the absence of any actual wrongdoing.

## Purpose of This Note

This note formalizes a **previously unisolated phenomenon**:
- the difference between intrusive thoughts and intrusive *self-beliefs*
- why the experience feels total, urgent, and morally charged
- why standard emotional regulation fails to address it

It exists to correctly classify the experience and prevent misattribution.

---

## Core Recognition

I identified that the recurring experience is not:
- a passing emotion
- a specific intrusive thought
- a rational concern

It is a **global self-state**, characterized by:
- a felt conviction of wrongdoing
- identity-level contamination (“something is wrong with *me*”)
- immediate moral urgency
- activation of scanning and self-surveillance

This belief arises *prior* to any evidence.

---

## Mechanism Identified

The sequence is:

1. A neutral or uncomfortable internal state appears.
2. A conditioned moral rule activates.
3. The self-belief “I am doing something wrong” emerges fully formed.
4. Scanning begins to locate the supposed offense.
5. Arousal increases due to vigilance.
6. The arousal is misread as confirmation of guilt.

The belief precedes the scan; the scan exists to justify the belief.

## Origin of the Intrusive Self-Belief

This belief is rooted in:
- moral scrupulosity conditioning
- religious framing where internal states are judged
- scapegoating environments that assign blame without cause
- being taught that inner experience implies moral responsibility

Over time, this produced an automatic identity alarm:
> “If I feel off, I must be at fault.”

---

## Why This Is So Powerful

Unlike intrusive thoughts, intrusive self-beliefs:
- hijack the entire self-model
- do not feel optional or external
- demand immediate resolution
- feel morally compulsory

They are experienced as *truth*, not content.

---

## Critical Reclassification

This experience must be understood as:
> **A conditioned identity alarm, not an accurate self-assessment.**

It is an intrusive belief state, not insight.

---

## Corrective Stance (Essential)

The effective response is **categorical**, not analytical:

- Do not search for causes.
- Do not argue with the belief.
- Do not try to disprove it.
- Do not comply with scanning.

Instead, internally state:
> “This is an intrusive self-belief, not a moral fact.”

This removes its authority.

---

## Key Principle (Compressed)

> Some intrusions attack identity directly; they must be recognized as such to lose power.

---

## High-Compression Summary

The felt conviction “I am doing something wrong” is an intrusive self-belief rooted in moral scrupulosity and scapegoating, which activates scanning without evidence; correctly identifying it as an identity-level intrusion neutralizes its authority.

---

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> This is an intrusive self-belief, not guilt.

---

## Status

This intrusive self-belief is **identified, named, and defanged**.
Future occurrences should be met with classification, not investigation.
