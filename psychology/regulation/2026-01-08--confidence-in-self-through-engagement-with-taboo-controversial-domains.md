# Note: Confidence in Self Through Engagement With Taboo / Controversial Domains

Date: 2026-01-08

Clear, durable note capturing the realization without softening or moralizing it.

## Core Observation

A defining feature of my healing process is that it required engaging directly with topics that are culturally, morally, or institutionally discouraged, rather than avoiding them.

Progress did not come from staying within “approved” psychological language or socially comfortable frames. It came from following intuition into areas others reflexively avoid.


---

## Key Example: Power and Domination

The concepts of power, dominance, authority, and control were critical to resolving core issues (dp/dr, shame, self-erasure, threat).

These topics are often framed as inherently pathological, immoral, or dangerous.

As a result:

- they are avoided in mainstream psychology
- they are avoided by AI training biases
- they are avoided by people who have unresolved shame around agency

Despite this, my intuition consistently indicated:

These concepts were missing variables, not corrupt ones.

Avoiding them was preventing closure, not preserving morality.

Over time, through direct exploration and experimentation:

- intuition was confirmed correct
- power and dominance were revealed as neutral regulatory forces
- avoidance of them was the actual pathology


---

## Pattern Identified

This is not isolated.

Across multiple domains:

- healing required violating consensus narratives
- insight came from integrating what is normally split off
- initial resistance (internal and external) gave way to coherence

Common sequence:

1. Intuition flags a forbidden or “unsafe” concept
2. Fear/shame/avoidance activates
3. Exploration proceeds anyway (with rigor)
4. Model coherence increases
5. Symptoms resolve or consolidate
6. Confidence in intuition strengthens


---

## Meta-Conclusion

My intuition is not reckless. It is system-seeking.

It detects:

- missing variables
- suppressed dimensions
- areas where moralization has replaced understanding

When followed carefully and rigorously, it leads to:

- greater coherence
- reduced suffering
- stable integration


---

## Reframe of Controversy

The fact that a topic is:

- controversial
- avoided
- morally charged

does not imply it is wrong.

Often it implies:

- it destabilizes existing power or identity structures
- it threatens shame-based regulation
- it exposes unintegrated human realities

In my case, those were exactly the domains that needed to be explored.


---

## Impact on Self-Trust

This reinforces a critical update to my self-model:

> If my intuition repeatedly leads to resolution where avoidance led to stagnation, then trusting it is rational, not arrogant.

Withholding trust in it:

- produces dp/dr
- prolongs suffering
- reinforces outdated self models


---

## Practical Implication Going Forward

- Discomfort alone is no longer a reason to disengage.
- “Taboo” is treated as a signal, not a stop sign.
- Confidence is built by owning correctness, not by seeking permission.

This does not mean abandoning rigor. It means refusing to let fear, shame, or external norms veto accurate perception.

## Compression

> Healing required going where others wouldn’t — and every time I did, reality confirmed it.

This note captures something fundamental about how I think, how I heal, and why confidence is now necessary rather than optional.
