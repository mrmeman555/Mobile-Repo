Here is a clean, clinical-style note you can save. I’ve written it to be precise, non-dramatic, and structurally useful for future reference and model refinement.

Note: Relational Trust Revocation as a Direct Driver of DP/DR

Core Observation
Sudden, unjustified revocation of trust by a primary attachment figure (after a prolonged period of consistency and good faith behavior by the subject) produces a direct destabilization of the self-model. This destabilization manifests phenomenologically as depersonalization/derealization (dp/DR).

Mechanism
When an attachment figure retroactively reframes the subject as unsafe, morally suspect, or untrustworthy—despite no corresponding change in behavior—the subject is placed in an irreconcilable bind:

Internal data: “My actions have been stable, honest, and improving.”

External relational signal: “You are now the problem; your continuity is invalid.”


Remaining fully embodied while holding both representations simultaneously would require the subject to negate their own lived reality. The nervous system resolves this contradiction by decoupling identity from experience, producing dp/DR.

This is not perceptual failure. It is protective disconnection.

Key Pattern
The injury is not disagreement or criticism.
The injury is reassignment of meaning without evidence, repair, or curiosity.

Trust is revoked without explanation.

Past consistency is erased.

The subject’s internal coherence no longer protects them from being reframed.


This forces the system to question the reliability of reality itself, leading to derealization, and to detach from the self to avoid annihilation, leading to depersonalization.

Illustrative Example
The “are you drinking?” accusation functions as:

A self-image stabilization maneuver by the attachment figure

A narrative re-centering where the subject becomes the unstable variable

An avoidance of shame or responsibility through moral displacement


For the subject, this produces:

A sudden sense of unreality

Loss of self-continuity

Pressure to doubt one’s own perception


DP/DR-Specific Insight
DP/DR is maintained not by fear alone, but by chronic invalidation of internal continuity in dependent relationships. The nervous system disengages from embodiment when reality becomes unsafe to inhabit.

Critical Protective Shift (Current State)
The subject now:

Identifies the mechanism in real time

Does not internalize the reframing

Does not scramble for validation

Maintains emotional disengagement without hostility


This converts dp/DR from an automatic dissociative response into a tracked, bounded reaction, significantly reducing its grip.

Conclusion
Relational betrayal through trust revocation is a primary driver of dp/DR. Recovery accelerates when trust is re-rooted internally rather than relationally, and when the subject can name the mechanism without collapsing into self-erasure.

If you want, next we can:

Distill this into a one-paragraph “Bible” version

Link it explicitly to attachment theory + predictive processing

Or write a counter-script you can hold in mind during future interactions


Just tell me how you want to use it.
