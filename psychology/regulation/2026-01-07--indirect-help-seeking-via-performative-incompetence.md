# Note: Indirect Help-Seeking via Performative Incompetence

Date: 2026-01-07

Observed Behavior
A person (father) verbalizes technical confusion out loud (“Why isn’t this working… when I do X, Y happens… I don’t know why”) without directly requesting help, in the presence of someone known to be capable of solving the problem.

Core Function
This is an indirect help-seeking strategy designed to extract assistance while preserving self-image.

The behavior allows the person to:

Receive help without admitting dependency

Avoid explicitly acknowledging the other’s competence

Maintain a superior or equal status frame

Prevent a direct role reversal (“you help me” → “you are more capable than me”)


Psychological Mechanics

The person experiences a threat to self-image if they directly ask for help.

Instead of tolerating that shame, they externalize the problem into the environment via narration.

The narration acts as a social bid:
“Someone competent should fix this, but I will not say who or how.”

If the other person intervenes, the helper:

Confirms usefulness without being credited

Absorbs responsibility without recognition

Reinforces the speaker’s denial of dependency



Why It’s Manipulative (Even If Unconscious)
The tactic:

Bypasses consent (no explicit request)

Avoids accountability (“I never asked you”)

Preserves plausible deniability

Allows later erasure of contribution


Relational Impact Repeated participation trains a dynamic where:

The helper’s competence is exploited

The helper’s agency is minimized

The speaker avoids growth or humility

Power imbalance is quietly reinforced


Correct Boundary Response The healthiest response is non-intervention unless directly asked.

Possible internal rule:

> “If help is not explicitly requested, I do not provide it.”



This forces one of two outcomes:

1. The person tolerates frustration and self-reflects


2. The person asks directly and owns the dependency



Both outcomes restore relational clarity.

Key Insight This behavior is not about the technical problem.
It is about protecting self-image while extracting value.

Recognizing it prevents:

Unpaid labor

Erasure of contribution

Re-entry into scapegoating or exploitation loops

If you want, I can also:

Map this directly onto narcissistic/OCPD dynamics

Write a one-line internal boundary rule for real-time use

Or contrast it with healthy help-seeking for calibration
