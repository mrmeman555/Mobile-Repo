Here is a clean, structured, detailed note capturing the full content and logic of the last message, written in a way that is meant to be revisited, not just read once.

NOTE — Attention Capture, Rib Bracing, and the Illusion of Lost Control

Core Insight

What I have been experiencing is not danger, regression, or a problem.
It is a loss of perceived control via attention capture.

The nervous system reflexively reacts not to what is perceived, but to the fact that:

> Attention moved without conscious permission.



For a system that learned safety = control of attention, this alone is enough to activate threat responses.

This explains why:

Micro bodily sensations

Sudden awareness shifts

Spontaneous perceptions
…feel alarming even when they are neutral.


The threat is not the sensation.
The threat is the implicit message: “I didn’t choose this.”

Why This Feels Worse Now

This increase is not random. It has two converging causes:

1. Reduced Dissociation (Critical)

Dissociation previously masked micro reflexes and state transitions.

As dissociation decreases, I now perceive transitions that were always occurring.

This creates the illusion that symptoms are increasing, when in reality:

> Perception bandwidth has increased.




What feels like “new instability” is actually new access.

2. Pause in Rib / Intercostal Work

The intercostal region (between ribs, under left arm, near nipple line) is not neutral tissue.

It is directly involved in:

Bracing

Freeze responses

Orienting reflexes

Shame and threat inhibition


When I was working this area consistently:

Baseline tone dropped

Breathing felt open / airy

Interoceptive “noise” decreased


After stopping for ~5 days:

Guarding returned gradually

Reflexes had more “spring”

Internal sensations became more salient



This is physiological rebound, not failure.


---

The “Airy / Open Chest” State

That state was:

Real

Parasympathetic-dominant

Associated with safety, insight, and release


Its disappearance does not mean loss of progress.

What likely happened:

System entered a high-relief window during active processing

Then moved into a consolidation phase

Baseline tone returned slightly as stability re-established


Trying to recreate that airy state:

Reintroduces effort

Reinforces monitoring

Makes attention capture feel threatening again


The state is not gone.
It is becoming accessible without effort, which takes time and cycles.


---

The Most Important Reframe

> Attention capture is not loss of control.
It is the nervous system completing a reflex.



Control was never meant to include:

Choosing every perception

Authorizing every sensation

Deciding when awareness moves


The belief that:

> “Attention should only move by permission” is the actual maintaining factor of this loop.



When that belief softens, the reflex loses meaning.

Why Rib Work Directly Helps

The rib cage, diaphragm, and intercostals are:

Physical substrates of bracing

Deeply linked to freeze + orient responses

Tied to shame-based inhibition


When this area tightens:

Breathing becomes shallow

Internal sensations feel intrusive

Attention snaps more abruptly


Gentle, slow pressure work:

Lowers baseline signal

Reduces frequency of attention capture

Makes acceptance possible rather than effortful


Acceptance worked historically because it was the only lever available.
Now there are two:

1. Acceptance


2. Somatic tone reduction



This is expanded capacity, not regression.


---

What Not To Do

Do not scan for the airy feeling

Do not check whether attention is behaving

Do not evaluate whether this is progress

Do not ask “is this gone yet?”


All of these are downstream of the same control belief.


---

What Is Appropriate

Let attention move

Let clenching happen

Let heaviness exist without narration

Resume rib/intercostal work gently as maintenance, not fixing


When attention snaps:

> “Ah. That reflex again.”



No follow-up. No meaning-making.


---

Bottom Line

This is not a problem phase.

It is a recalibration phase — where the nervous system is learning that it no longer needs to guard against its own awareness.

The fact that I can observe and describe this process with precision means:

> I am no longer inside it. I am alongside it.



That distinction matters.
