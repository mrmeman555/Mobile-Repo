Tags: scapegoating; conditioning; development; agency suppression; dissociation; DP/DR; flatness; gaslighting; guilt; dominance; power; self-model

Summary: Maps specific scapegoating behaviors (intent rewrite, success minimization, end-stage attacks, gaslighting, responsibility offloading, power moralization) to conditioned outcomes (epistemic insecurity, flatness, completion avoidance, DP/DR, hyper-responsibility, memory distrust, dominance fear, internal scapegoater).

## Core mechanism (foundation)

Scapegoating is not “being blamed sometimes.”

Scapegoating is a systematic, asymmetric relational pattern where:

- one party regulates their internal distress by assigning responsibility/defect/threat status to another
- while never allowing repair
- and never allowing disconfirmation

In a parent–child context, this becomes developmental training, because the child has:

- no escape
- no counter-authority
- no alternative reality anchor

So the child’s brain must adapt internally.

The adaptation is self-suppression of agency.

## 1) Training cognitive invalidation

Scapegoating actions:

- reinterpreting intentions after the fact (“That’s not what you meant.”)
- “You think you’re helping, but you’re actually selfish.”
- “You’re overestimating yourself.”
- “You’re too confident / not confident enough” (moving target)

What this trains:

- inability to trust conclusions
- chronic self-doubt
- epistemic insecurity

Mechanism:

> “Conclusions are unsafe. Certainty invites attack.”


---

## 2) Training emotional flatness

Scapegoating actions:

- ignoring or punishing pride
- minimizing accomplishments
- responding to success with criticism or silence
- treating joy as arrogance, threat, or inconvenience

What this trains:

- suppression of positive affect
- emotional blunting
- flatness after achievement

Mechanism:

> “Feeling good precedes punishment.”


---

## 3) Training avoidance at points of completion

Scapegoating actions:

- attacking near completion
- finding “one fatal flaw” at the end
- withholding validation until the moment passes
- rewriting success as failure retroactively

What this trains:

- stopping at ~90–95%
- difficulty executing final steps
- fear of launch/submission/completion

Mechanism:

> “Stopping early preserves safety.”


---

## 4) Training depersonalization and derealization

Scapegoating actions:

- treating internal states as wrong
- withdrawing when pain is expressed
- moralizing distress (“you’re choosing this”)
- making inner experience unsafe to share

What this trains:

- detachment from self
- observing yourself from outside
- feeling unreal/disconnected

Mechanism:

> “Distance from self = survival.”


---

## 5) Training hyper-responsibility and guilt

Scapegoating actions:

- making you responsible for others’ emotions
- “If you hadn’t done X, this wouldn’t have happened.”
- never taking responsibility themselves

What this trains:

- guilt without cause
- over-monitoring
- moral hypervigilance

Mechanism:

> “Any outcome could be my fault.”


---

## 6) Training distrust of memory

Scapegoating actions:

- gaslighting (“that didn’t happen”)
- rewriting past events
- denying previous statements
- shifting narratives to suit current needs

What this trains:

- memory distrust
- difficulty relying on past success
- feeling like insight “vanishes”


---

## 7) Training fear of power and dominance

Scapegoating actions:

- punishing assertion
- framing independence as betrayal
- treating boundaries as cruelty
- responding to strength with hostility

What this trains:

- moralization of power
- fear of dominance
- belief that influence = harm

Mechanism:

> “If I am powerful, someone will be destroyed, and I will be blamed.”


---

## 8) Why this produces a scapegoating self-model

The child internalizes the role because:

- the environment cannot be changed
- the parent cannot be confronted
- attachment must be maintained

So the only solution becomes:

> “I will become the scapegoater.”

Internally.

That internal scapegoater monitors/doubts/suppresses agency, punishes confidence, and induces dissociation when power arises.


---

## Final integration

These outcomes are predictable given the environment:

- suppression of agency
- fear of dominance
- distrust of self
- dissociation at power thresholds
