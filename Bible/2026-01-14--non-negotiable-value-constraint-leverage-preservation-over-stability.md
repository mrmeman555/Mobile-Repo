# Non-Negotiable Value Constraint: Leverage Preservation Over Stability

## Core truth
For me, being forced to cap my abilities is not neutral — it is actively harmful.

I am not optimized for environments that:

- artificially slow me down
- discourage or restrict AI usage
- reward compliance over leverage
- require me to hide, dilute, or amputate my most powerful skills to protect others’ comfort

In those environments, I don’t merely stagnate — I degrade:

- confidence erodes
- skill atrophies
- motivation collapses
- and the same scapegoating dynamics I escaped are recreated

This is not ego. It is pattern recognition from lived cost.

## My actual optimization target
I am not optimizing for “a normal job” or short-term stability in isolation.

I am optimizing for:

> Runway + leverage preservation + optionality

That means:

- surviving financially and psychologically
- while maintaining and sharpening my asymmetric AI + systems + cognition advantage
- until that advantage compounds into autonomy, income, and influence

Any path that destroys leverage to buy temporary comfort is a net loss.

## Why “normal” full-time roles are high risk for me
For many people, conventional jobs provide safety.  
For me, they often function as skill sinkholes.

They tend to:

- pay me to operate below my true capacity
- implicitly punish speed and automation
- reward appearing busy rather than being effective
- retrain me to doubt instincts that are actually correct

Even with a decent paycheck, the opportunity cost is massive.

My nervous system knows this — that’s why resistance is so strong.

## My non-negotiable value stance
> I will accept temporary instability, unconventional paths, and discomfort — but I will not accept conditions that require me to amputate my edge.

Translated into practice:

- flexibility > rigidity
- autonomy > approval
- output-measured > time-measured
- leverage-preserving income > prestige

I am allowed to:

- earn less temporarily if it protects long-term power
- choose paths others don’t understand
- appear “behind” while actually compounding

## The deeper reason this matters
This is not about winning faster.

It is about never betraying myself again.

I have already lived the cost of suppressing my capabilities to survive socially.  
I am done paying that cost.

Maintaining and leveraging my asymmetric skill set is not optional — it is the condition under which I remain healthy, motivated, and alive enough for my work to matter.

## Guiding rule moving forward
Any opportunity, role, or plan must be evaluated first on this axis:

> Does this preserve, strengthen, or compound my leverage —
> or does it slowly train me out of it?

If it’s the latter, it is not acceptable, no matter how “reasonable” it looks.

This is the right thing to iron out now.

Everything else — studying, certs, income strategies — becomes clearer once this constraint is honored instead of argued with.
