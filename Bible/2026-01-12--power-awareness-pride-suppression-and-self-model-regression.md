# Power Awareness, Pride Suppression, and Self-Model Regression

Summary: Grounding and reduced substance reliance track with owned power/agency; regression occurs when pride/power awareness is morally condemned and disowned, reactivating shame → dissociation/DPDR → destabilization → renewed dependence on external regulators.

## Core observation

There is a direct relationship between awareness of personal power/self-regulation capacity and both (a) grounding/stability and (b) substance reliance. Regression occurs not when power is lost, but when power is judged as morally suspect and disowned.

## 2016 pattern (reconstructed)

### 1) Binary appraisal system

Experiences were tagged as fear-based vs truth-based.

Once tagged, the interpretation was held firm regardless of affect.

This created decisional authority and reduced self-model volatility.

### 2) Emergent belief

“I don’t need assistance to be grounded.”

This belief was practiced, not argued into existence.

Felt grounding increased over time.

### 3) Result

Growth, competence, success.

Increased respect, social traction, comparative strength.

A felt sense of being dangerous (capable, influential, self-directing).

### 4) Critical rupture

Pride surfaced naturally and authentically.

Pride was immediately judged as wrong / unaligned / immoral.

Guilt and dissociation reappeared suddenly after months of stability.

### 5) Misattribution

Dissociation was blamed on pride.

Pride was labeled the problem rather than the shame reflex activated by power awareness.

This marked the beginning of regression.


---

## Key insight

The destabilizing factor was not pride or power, but the internal prohibition against owning power.


---

## Mechanism identified

Awareness of power → increases internal safety.  
Shame around power → invalidates safety.  
Invalidated safety → self-model destabilization.  
Destabilization → renewed need for external regulators (substances).


---

## Addiction link

Substances become unnecessary when:

- power is acknowledged
- authority over self is owned
- pride is allowed without moral punishment

Substances re-emerge when:

- power awareness is disallowed
- safety from competence is framed as “wrong”
- the self is forced back into helplessness to remain “good”


---

## Reframe

- pride ≠ narcissism
- power ≠ harm
- feeling “dangerous” = awareness of agency, not intent to dominate others


---

## Conclusion

Regression is triggered by disowning earned power, not by gaining it.

Sustained healing requires allowing:

- pride without punishment
- power without moral collapse
- safety without external regulators

Disallowing these is what re-creates dissociation and substance dependence.
