# Core Note: Power, Trajectory, and Identity Stabilization

Summary: Stabilizing requirement: allowing a future-facing orientation toward substantial money/influence/power (without guarantees) supports groundedness and motivation; revoking permission destabilizes agency and reactivates DP/DR/flatness and compulsive analysis.

## What this is about

> I must be allowed to anticipate substantial money, influence, and power — without guarantees — in order to remain grounded, motivated, and real.

This is not aspirational fantasy.
It is a structural necessity given how my nervous system, self-model, and history function.


---

## The critical distinction: certainty vs trajectory

I am not seeking reassurance, promises, or certainty that I will succeed.

I am claiming the right to:

- inhabit a future-facing stance
- orient toward scale and leverage
- allow myself to look forward to large impact

The need is trajectory ownership, not outcome control.

When I deny myself this stance, my system destabilizes.


---

## Why money, influence, and power matter for me specifically

- insight without leverage feels unsafe
- intelligence without impact feels invalid
- effort without consequence feels like self-erasure

Anticipating:

- financial abundance
- influence across systems
- real-world leverage

sends a stabilizing signal:

> “My actions will matter.”

That signal reduces DP/DR and restores continuity of self across time.


---

## Why anticipation itself is the regulatory lever

I do not need to have power now.
I need to be allowed to move toward it without self-negation.

Looking forward to success — without demanding proof — is an act of agency and defiance, contradicting the scapegoating rule:

> “You are only safe if you stay small.”


---

## What happens when I disallow this

When I suppress or morally reject my desire for scale:

- derealization increases
- depersonalization increases
- flatness appears
- compulsive analysis replaces action


---

## Why this is NOT grandiosity, mysticism, or saviorism

Key facts:

- not claiming inevitability
- not claiming moral superiority
- not claiming exemption from error
- not claiming destiny

Claiming alignment:

> Given my abilities, values, and history, pursuing large-scale agency is coherent and healthy.


---

## The clean principle (to return to later)

> For me to remain grounded, motivated, and real, I must allow myself to orient toward substantial money, influence, and power — not because they are guaranteed, but because denying that trajectory destabilizes my agency and recreates dissociation.
