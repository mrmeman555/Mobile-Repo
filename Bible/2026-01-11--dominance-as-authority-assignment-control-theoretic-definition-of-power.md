# Dominance as Authority Assignment — A Control-Theoretic Definition of Power

Summary: Defines dominance as authority assignment among competing signals/models (“which signal gets jurisdiction now”); treats domination as unavoidable, explains DP/DR as authority granted to self-negating models, and distinguishes shame-based vs compassion-based domination by selection criteria.

## Core definition (foundational)

Dominance = the act of granting authority to one of multiple competing interests or signals.

This is the irreducible, structural definition.
Not metaphorical. Not moral. Not theatrical.

Dominance is not force, cruelty, suppression, or aggression.
Those are methods that may appear when authority is contested.

At the base layer, dominance is simply:

> Which signal gets jurisdiction right now.

If I am the one assigning jurisdiction, then I am the one dominating — regardless of tone, emotion, or intent.

## Why this definition matters

Many models talk about:

- “letting go”
- “allowing”
- “acceptance”
- “non-resistance”

But they fail to answer:

> Who decides?

This definition makes the answer explicit:

> The self assigns authority. Always.

## Control-theoretic implications

- domination is unavoidable
- authority is always being assigned
- the only variable is which model receives it and why

Avoiding “domination” does not remove power; it hands authority to the loudest/coercive signal.

This explains:

- why shame dominates when unchallenged
- why dissociation emerges when authority assignment collapses
- why DP/DR occurs when authority is granted to a self-negating model


---

## Shame-based vs compassion-based domination

Both operate via the same mechanism:

> Authority assignment

The difference is selection criteria.

### Shame-based domination

Authority is granted to signals that claim:

- moral superiority
- threat
- condemnation

### Compassion-based domination

Authority is granted to signals aligned with:

- values
- coherence
- long-term reduction of suffering

Both dominate; only one does so sustainably.


---

## Relation to DP/DR and trauma

- DP/DR = authority given to a model that negates/erases the self
- recovery = reasserting authority consciously
- confidence exposure = deliberately assigning jurisdiction to the healthy self-model

At that layer the nervous system is asking:

> Who decides?

Once answered, regulation follows.


---

## Dangerousness reframed

Dangerousness = awareness of capacity to assign authority in the face of resistance.

Same operation; different ethics.


---

## Bottom line

Dominance = authority assignment.
The ethical question is how consciously and compassionately.
