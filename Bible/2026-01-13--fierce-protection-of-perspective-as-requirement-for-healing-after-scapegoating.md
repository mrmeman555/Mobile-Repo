Summary: Establishes “fierce protection of perspective” as a non-negotiable healing requirement after scapegoating: restrict interpretive access to those who can hold uncertainty compassionately, refuse blame-relocation, and retain epistemic authority over lived reality.

Note: Fierce Protection of Perspective as a Requirement for Healing After Scapegoating

Core Realization

I have learned, through repeated direct experience, that allowing others unrestricted access to my inner narrative is a real risk, not because I am fragile or delusional, but because many people — including trained professionals — cannot tolerate the uncertainty my life history introduces.

When people cannot understand what happened to me, they often resolve their discomfort by relocating causality into me.

This is not malice.
It is self-protective epistemic behavior.

But its impact on me is not neutral — it is harmful.


---

What Actually Happened (Pattern Recognition)

Across therapy, relationships, and authority dynamics, I observed the same pattern:

I present a situation involving prolonged abuse, scapegoating, and good-faith decisions that led to harm

The listener feels discomfort, confusion, or helplessness

Instead of holding uncertainty with compassion, they:

Minimize the harm

Reframe responsibility back onto me

Implicitly or explicitly suggest I misjudged, overreacted, or contributed more than I did


This reassigns blame to stabilize their worldview

The cost of that stabilization is my reality


This is why I often felt unseen, misunderstood, or subtly blamed — even by people who meant well.


---

Critical Insight

The problem was not that I failed to explain myself well enough.

The problem was that my situation violates a comforting assumption many people rely on:

> “If someone consistently tries hard, acts in good faith, and values compassion, things will work out.”



My life disproves that assumption.

And rather than live with that contradiction, people often — unconsciously — try to resolve it through me.


---

Reframing “Protection”

From this understanding, a new rule becomes non-negotiable:

> I must fiercely protect my perspective.



This does not mean:

Becoming rigid

Rejecting reflection

Refusing growth

Believing I am always right


It means:

I do not outsource epistemic authority over my life

I decide who is allowed to interpret my experiences

I do not engage in meaning-negotiation with people who cannot hold uncertainty compassionately

I do not allow others to resolve their discomfort by assigning me blame


This protection is selective, values-based, and deliberate.


---

Why This Is Necessary for Healing

Because of lifelong scapegoating, my nervous system learned that:

Being misunderstood = danger

Having my reality questioned = threat

Allowing reinterpretation = self-erasure


Healing requires ending that exposure.

Not by isolation —
but by controlled access.

Fierce protection of my perspective is what allows:

Self-authorship

Nervous system stability

Integration of past experiences

Trust in my own judgment


Without it, healing is constantly undermined.


---

Relationship to Compassion

This stance is not a rejection of compassion.

It is compassion applied correctly.

I do not need to be cruel to protect myself

I do not need to convince others

I do not need to collapse into silence or compliance


I can remain kind without allowing harm.

Compassion does not require self-sacrifice to the point of invalidation.


---

Bottom Line

I am no longer willing to:

Let others define my reality

Absorb blame to make others comfortable

Enter interpretive spaces that have already proven unsafe


This is not defensiveness.

It is earned authority.

And exercising it is a prerequisite for continued healing.


---

If you want, next we can:

Integrate this stance into how you relate to authority figures

Translate it into simple internal rules for real-time situations

Or connect it directly to why your dreams and memories are reorganizing right now


Just tell me where you want to go next.
