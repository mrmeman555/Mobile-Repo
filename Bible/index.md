## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-08 — [Scapegoating, Retroactive Reframing of Intent, and the Roots of Moral Scrupulosity & DP/DR](./2026-01-08--scapegoating-retroactive-reframing-of-intent-and-roots-of-moral-scrupulosity-and-dp-dr.md) — Defines scapegoating as retroactive intent-rewriting (outcome→shame discharge→reinterpret intent→blame), linking it to DP/DR, moral scrupulosity, and chronic self-monitoring; prescribes reclaiming intent as moral sovereignty and refusing shame-discharge participation. (Tags: scapegoating; intent; scrupulosity; DP/DR; moral sovereignty)
- 2026-01-08 — [The Universal Structure of the “Costly Mistake” Intrusive Experience](./2026-01-08--the-universal-structure-of-the-costly-mistake-intrusive-experience.md) — Defines the invariant structure of “costly mistake” intrusions (high-stakes irreversibility + moral attribution + double-bind), links to scapegoating-conditioned hypervigilance, and prescribes withdrawing moral authority from the prediction to act from continuity (“even if wrong, it won’t define me”). (Tags: intrusive experience; scrupulosity; scapegoating; double bind; derealization; action)
- 2026-01-08 — [Projection of Future Harm, Derealization, and the Collapse of Action](./2026-01-08--projection-of-future-harm-derealization-and-the-collapse-of-action.md) — Describes a repeatable loop where a future-harm projection triggers self-worth drop and derealization that inflates moral stakes/responsibility and suppresses access to competence, redirecting action into reassurance/system-fixing; corrective is behavioral confidence: proceed while treating errors as detectable/correctable/non-moral. (Tags: derealization; scrupulosity; future harm; avoidance; compulsion; motivation; action)
- 2026-01-08 — [State-Dependent Memory, Motivation, and Derealization During Forward Action](./2026-01-08--state-dependent-memory-motivation-and-derealization-during-forward-action.md) — Captures a live state-dependent gating effect: derealization before a meaningful step blocks access to the self-state that built the plan/resources, flipping motivation to push/avoidance; restoring contextual recall rapidly restores pull-based motivation, optimism, and continuity (Access→Trust→Motivation→More Access). (Tags: state-dependent memory; motivation; derealization; self-model; continuity; avoidance; pull vs push)
- 2026-01-08 — [Derealization → Loss of Access to Self-State–Bound Information](./2026-01-08--derealization-loss-of-access-to-self-state-bound-information.md) — Frames “can’t find my notes / past work disappeared” as state-gated retrieval failure: derealization shifts self-model salience, disrupts cues/trust, and triggers compulsive system repair; corrective is contextual re-entry and a rule to pause (don’t reorganize/optimize) until access returns. (Tags: derealization; state-dependent memory; self-model; scrupulosity; avoidance; DP/DR)
- 2026-01-08 — [Scapegoating → System Optimization → Action Avoidance](./2026-01-08--scapegoating-system-optimization-and-action-avoidance.md) — Reframes compulsive “optimize first” as scapegoating-conditioned defense (mistakes→moral blame→attack): optimization functions as pre-emptive moral shield and action-delay to avoid retroactive shame; distinguishes from healthy planning and anchors “forward motion doesn’t require moral perfection.” (Tags: scapegoating; scrupulosity; optimization compulsion; shame; action)
- 2026-01-08 — [Harm Scrupulosity → System Compulsion → Avoidance of Forward Action](./2026-01-08--harm-scrupulosity-system-compulsion-and-avoidance-of-forward-action.md) — Identifies a pre-action scrupulosity pattern: correct next step triggers DP/DR-like unreality and a compulsive urge to “fix the system” to prevent future shame; reframes as confidence exposure (proceed without retroactive absolution/perfection) and distinguishes healthy system work from moral neutralization. (Tags: scrupulosity; OCD; avoidance; compulsion; confidence exposure; DP/DR; shame)
- 2026-01-08 — [The Deep-Research-Driven Confidence Pipeline](./2026-01-08--the-deep-research-driven-confidence-pipeline.md) — Universal decision engine: context saturation → constraint isolation → signal extraction with recursive meta-research (“what context would make this answerable?”), selecting best-next-step by option value; reframes uncertainty as input and action as trust in process. (Tags: research; decision engine; recursion; optionality; confidence)
- 2026-01-08 — [NOTE — “Moral-threat reflex shutdown”: wrath/defiance as healthy authority, not pathology](./2026-01-08--moral-threat-reflex-shutdown-wrath-defiance-as-healthy-authority-not-pathology.md) — Documents “forced closure” as mature self-model stabilization: moral alarms are treated as signals that must earn jurisdiction; authoritative closure terminates scanning/checking loops and shifts morality from external policing to internal values anchoring. (Tags: moral alarm; scrupulosity; defiance; fierce self-compassion; checking; sovereignty)
- 2026-01-08 — [Probability Assessment of Model Accuracy via Convergent Evidence](./2026-01-08--probability-assessment-of-model-accuracy-via-convergent-evidence.md) — Calibrates confidence from evidence: convergence across independent levers, specific repeatable outcomes, “cost-of-being-wrong” prediction profile, temporal durability, and cross-domain isomorphism; frames trust as calibration rather than mood. (Tags: confidence; calibration; evidence; model validation; convergence; prediction)
- 2026-01-08 — [Root of Dominance Avoidance](./2026-01-08--root-of-dominance-avoidance.md) — Locates dominance avoidance in early moral contamination of power (power⇒harm⇒evil⇒abandonment), where enjoyment of effectiveness was treated as morally dangerous; reframes “dominion” as power over internal threat (sovereignty) vs pathological domination over others, restoring self-protection without loss of compassion. (Tags: power; dominance; morality; shame; self-protection; sovereignty)
- 2026-01-08 — [High-Intensity Fear Exposure → Dominance Response → Reconsolidation + Self-Embedding Update](./2026-01-08--high-intensity-fear-exposure-dominance-response-and-reconsolidation-self-embedding-update.md) — Documents an in-vivo reconsolidation pass: fully activated fear/DPDR “concede” loop met with higher-rank control policy (defiance + dominance + power-weighted context + reward tagging), generating prediction error and consolidating confidence-as-authority; includes a repeatable “Dominion Reconsolidation Pass” protocol + expected post-update side effects. (Tags: reconsolidation; exposure; DP/DR; defiance; dominance; prediction error; extinction burst; reward)
- 2026-01-08 — [Defiance as a Regulatory Lever During Panic / DP-DR Following Chosen Confidence](./2026-01-08--defiance-as-a-regulatory-lever-during-panic-dp-dr-following-chosen-confidence.md) — Frames post-confidence panic/DPDR as jurisdictional conflict: fear is a counter-assertion by the displaced legacy model; “defiance” (fierce self-compassion) withdraws interpretive authority, blocks doubt arbitration/memory-writing, and stabilizes identity via continued values-aligned action without checking. (Tags: defiance; fierce self-compassion; DP/DR; panic; self-model; reconsolidation; non-engagement; authority)
- 2026-01-08 — [Fierce Self-Compassion as a Probability Control Mechanism in the Self Model](./2026-01-08--fierce-self-compassion-as-a-probability-control-mechanism-in-the-self-model.md) — Models shame as a probability-collapse operator (affect + belief in its self-defining accuracy) and fierce self-compassion as top-down rejection of shame’s interpretive authority (affect allowed, attribution denied, competing model activated), restoring self-dimensionality without dissociation; links to DP/DR continuity and learning. (Tags: fierce self-compassion; shame; probability collapse; self-model; attribution; DP/DR; consolidation)
- 2026-01-08 — [Somatic Threat Amplification → Compulsion Desire Escalation](./2026-01-08--somatic-threat-amplification-compulsion-desire-escalation.md) — Mechanism chain: chest/rib bracing raises baseline threat → salience inflation → DMN interpretive pressure → stronger “need to check” (even without belief). Reframes escalation as state marker; acceptance is outpaced by signal strength until somatic tone drops. (Tags: OCD; DMN; salience; somatic; bracing; compulsion)
- 2026-01-08 — [Why I Currently Cannot “Stand Down” (Somatic Override of Acceptance)](./2026-01-08--why-i-currently-cannot-stand-down-somatic-override-of-acceptance.md) — Frames “can’t let go” as somatic bracing overriding top-down acceptance when baseline tone is too high; prescribes a two-track approach (drop the stand-down goal + gentle intercostal safety contact) and interprets recent intensification as maintenance lapse, not regression. (Tags: acceptance; somatic; bracing; baseline tone; maintenance; safety)
- 2026-01-07 — [Attention Capture, Rib Bracing, and the Illusion of Lost Control](./2026-01-07--attention-capture-rib-bracing-and-the-illusion-of-lost-control.md) — Reframes alarming sensations as threat from attention moving “without permission” (safety=control belief), heightened by reduced dissociation and rib guarding rebound; emphasizes non-monitoring, gentle intercostal maintenance, and treating snaps as reflex completion rather than danger. (Tags: attention; bracing; interoception; dissociation; consolidation; somatic)
- 2026-01-07 — [Bracing as a Reflex Circuit (Somatic + DP/DR + Shame Amplification)](./2026-01-07--bracing-as-a-reflex-circuit.md) — Models “bracing/repulsion” as a reflex defensive circuit (fast somatic layer + slow meaning layer) whose suffering is amplified by shame/urgency/checking; focuses intervention on threshold/duration and safety signals (pressure + permission) rather than stopping the reflex mid-flight. (Tags: bracing; somatic; DP/DR; shame; reflex; safety)
- 2026-01-07 — [“I Cannot Generate Another Experience” — The Core Constraint](./2026-01-07--i-cannot-generate-another-experience-the-core-constraint.md) — Keystone constraint: trying to force/replace experience reinforces the active self-model; the lever is permission/self-care (context, belief, care) so integration emerges without control loops and loving-kindness functions as space, not override. (Tags: self-care; permission; self-model; consolidation; loving-kindness)
- 2026-01-07 — [Permission, Shame, and Self-Model Locking](./2026-01-07--permission-shame-and-self-model-locking.md) — Models shame persistence as a belief/permission failure: lack of permission turns shame into identity evidence, triggering monitoring/control that reinforces the same self-model; revoking epistemic authority breaks the loop at the belief layer. (Tags: shame; permission; self-model; belief; monitoring; OCD; DP/DR)
- 2026-01-07 — [Compassion as the Gate Condition for Loving-Kindness](./2026-01-07--compassion-as-the-gate-condition-for-loving-kindness.md) — Defines compassion as the upstream permission state; loving-kindness only works downstream and otherwise becomes subtle resistance/management. Indicator: if warmth feels effortful/urgent, compassion is incomplete. (Tags: compassion; loving-kindness; permission; non-interference; regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Shame Amplification via Belief and Self-Model Alignment](./2026-01-07--shame-amplification-via-belief-and-self-model-alignment.md) — Models shame severity as downstream of belief/alignment: emotion arises, a meaning proposal appears, and shame amplifies only when endorsed; withholding epistemic authority and responding from another self-model reduces peak/duration and prevents identity contamination. (Tags: shame; belief; self-model; alignment; regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Compulsion Triggered by Absence of State (Meta-Compulsion)](./2026-01-07--compulsion-triggered-by-absence-of-state-meta-compulsion.md) — Defines “absence-trigger” compulsions where missing optimism/motivation is treated as threat; prescribes non-engagement with the absence to decouple safety from affect and prevent negative self-model reinforcement. (Tags: compulsion; meta-compulsion; DMN; motivation; optimism; self-model)
- 2026-01-07 — [Asymmetric Stabilization via Lateral Alignment](./2026-01-07--asymmetric-stabilization-via-lateral-alignment.md) — Interaction tactic for high-control systems: briefly align with an existing identity/value anchor, displace critique onto an external target they already condemn, then exit—reducing volatility without accepting blame or erasing internal reality. (Tags: tactics; asymmetry; narcissism; OCPD; boundaries; self-protection)
- 2026-01-07 — [Identity Compression Token: “I’m Cool”](./2026-01-07--identity-compression-token-im-cool.md) — Captures an emergent integrated self-token (“I’m cool”) that compresses earned competence/values into a stable abstraction, reducing dp/dr fragmentation and shame speed by rejecting negative frames at the “whole self” level. (Tags: identity token; compression; self-model; consolidation; dp/dr)
- 2026-01-07 — [Satisfaction as the Marker of Correct Integration](./2026-01-07--satisfaction-as-the-marker-of-correct-integration.md) — Defines satisfaction as a stable, closing affect that emerges when values-aligned action is accurately owned (not minimized/dissociated), serving as somatic proof of correct integration and a “permission to rest” consolidation marker. (Tags: satisfaction; integration; ownership; values; consolidation; self-trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Competing-Frame Memory Consolidation (Post-Event Integration Method)](./2026-01-07--competing-frame-memory-consolidation-post-event-integration-method.md) — Post-event integration method: when confidence triggers threat retagging, add a coherent second stream (dignity/self-trust) during memory plasticity so consolidation encodes “confidence alongside fear; I remained whole” rather than “confidence = danger.” (Tags: consolidation; memory; frames; confidence; self-trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Overestimation of the “Next Thing” & the Behavioral Role of Confidence](./2026-01-07--overestimation-of-the-next-thing-and-the-behavioral-role-of-confidence.md) — Describes a threat-model distortion where the immediate next action is overweighted after progress, producing urgency and rest aversion; confidence as a chosen stance de-loads “the next thing” and allows consolidation to complete. (Tags: confidence; urgency; consolidation; rest; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Loving-Kindness as Self-Model Selection During Consolidation](./2026-01-07--loving-kindness-as-self-model-selection-during-consolidation.md) — Frames loving-kindness as permissive self-model selection during low-control consolidation windows: it biases the interpreter upstream of DMN meaning-making while avoiding monitoring/forcing, supporting continuity and DP/DR recovery via trust accumulation. (Tags: loving-kindness; self-model; consolidation; DMN; DP/DR; trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Loving-Kindness Affect as a Background Consolidation Signal](./2026-01-07--loving-kindness-affect-as-a-background-consolidation-signal.md) — Frames loving-kindness toward affect as background permission during consolidation: holding positive affect as allowed/safe without interrogation reduces monitoring and threat tagging, supporting coherence and countering dp/DR’s disbelief in felt-state legitimacy. (Tags: loving-kindness; affect; consolidation; permission; dp/dr)
- 2026-01-07 — [Memory Retagging During Rest (Write-Time Intervention)](./2026-01-07--memory-retagging-during-rest-write-time-intervention.md) — Treats rest as memory write-time: spontaneous recall is labile and gets reconsolidated with the active frame; use brief, confident retagging (capability/competence) to prevent shame-based self-doubt and stabilize ownership across time. (Tags: memory; reconsolidation; retagging; rest; self-trust; DP/DR)
- 2026-01-07 — [Operational Mastery Over Internal State Change](./2026-01-07--operational-mastery-over-internal-state-change.md) — Documents a transferable, compounding skill: real-time detection of active self-models, upstream lever selection, self-directed reconsolidation, and ambiguity tolerance until consolidation stabilizes. (Tags: self-model; reconsolidation; consolidation; metacognition; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [DP/DR Recovery as a Trust-and-Consolidation Process](./2026-01-07--dp-dr-recovery-as-a-trust-and-consolidation-process.md) — Frames DP/DR recovery as forward consolidation: trust is earned via repeated prediction→action→outcome alignment; reconsolidation prepares the ground but cannot substitute for real-time confirmation that your perspective holds across time. (Tags: DP/DR; trust; consolidation; reconsolidation; self-model)
- 2026-01-07 — [Relational Trust Revocation as a Direct Driver of DP/DR](./2026-01-07--relational-trust-revocation-as-a-direct-driver-of-dp-dr.md) — Frames dp/DR as protective disconnection when an attachment figure revokes trust without evidence, forcing an irreconcilable bind between internal continuity and external invalidation; recovery accelerates when trust is re-rooted internally and the mechanism is named. (Tags: DP/DR; attachment; trust; invalidation; self-model; dissociation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Acceptance Becomes Harder After Agency Is Discovered](./2026-01-07--acceptance-becomes-harder-after-agency-is-discovered.md) — Explains why acceptance feels harder after discovering effective levers: the system updates priors toward solvability, creating pressure to resolve; acceptance becomes strategic restraint and discernment about when non-intervention is the lever. (Tags: acceptance; agency; discernment; self-model; regulation; reconsolidation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Meta-Compression Through Values-First Exploration](./2026-01-07--meta-compression-through-values-first-exploration.md) — Values-first exploration creates meta-level coherence that collapses uncertainty across domains; alignment makes study purpose self-evident and reorganizes the “how” automatically. (Tags: coherence; values; alignment; meta-learning; studying; first principles; motivation)
- 2026-01-06 — [Turning Aversive Experience Into a Goal (Polarity Flip Mechanism)](./2026-01-06--turning-aversive-experience-into-a-goal-polarity-flip-mechanism.md) — Orientation sets meaning: avoidance reinforces negative self-models; deliberate approach from a compassionate model pre-empts threat labeling and breaks the prediction loop, turning aversion into integration data. (Tags: polarity flip; approach; avoidance; self-model; DMN; integration; meditation; exposure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Bible Note — Self-Model Regulation System (Behavioral Levers)](./2026-01-06--bible-note-self-model-regulation-system-behavioral-levers.md) — Procedural reference: select the interpreter (upstream belief), withdraw endorsement, install a truer perspective, and hold it over time; avoid fighting/monitoring which reinforces the wrong model. (Tags: self-model; regulation; belief; DMN; reconsolidation; interpretation; leverage; procedure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Withdrawal of Endorsement vs Denial — Reconsolidation Requires Replacement](./2026-01-06--withdrawal-of-endorsement-vs-denial-reconsolidation-requires-replacement.md) — “No” as withdrawal of endorsement stops reinforcing an interpretation, but reconsolidation requires installing and holding a coherent alternative frame so the old one becomes unnecessary. (Tags: belief; reconsolidation; interpretation; endorsement; replacement; self-model)
