- 2026-01-06 — [Bible Note — Self-Model Regulation System (Behavioral Levers)](./2026-01-06--bible-note-self-model-regulation-system-behavioral-levers.md) — Procedural reference: select the interpreter (upstream belief), withdraw endorsement, install a truer perspective, and hold it over time; avoid fighting/monitoring which reinforces the wrong model. (Tags: self-model; regulation; belief; DMN; reconsolidation; interpretation; leverage; procedure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Withdrawal of Endorsement vs Denial — Reconsolidation Requires Replacement](./2026-01-06--withdrawal-of-endorsement-vs-denial-reconsolidation-requires-replacement.md) — “No” as withdrawal of endorsement stops reinforcing an interpretation, but reconsolidation requires installing and holding a coherent alternative frame so the old one becomes unnecessary.
