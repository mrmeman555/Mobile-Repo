- 2026-01-13 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-13--eye-gaze-orienting-as-bottom-up-access-path-to-self-contact.md) — When top-down regulation (meditation/insight) fails to restore authentic self-contact, eye gaze/orienting reliably works by re-establishing perceptual presence via bottom-up sensory–occulomotor–vestibular–autonomic coupling. (Tags: eye gaze; orienting; bottom-up regulation; dissociation; DP/DR; meditation; autonomic; vestibular; oculomotor; presence)
- 2026-01-13 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-13--fierce-protection-of-perspective-as-requirement-for-healing-after-scapegoating.md) — Establishes “fierce protection of perspective” as a non-negotiable healing requirement after scapegoating: restrict interpretive access to those who can hold uncertainty compassionately, refuse blame-relocation, and retain epistemic authority over lived reality. (Tags: scapegoating; epistemic authority; perspective protection; self-authorship; boundaries; therapy; meaning-negotiation; healing)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--self-authorship-via-interpretive-authority-dpdr-resolution.md) — DP/DR resolves when interpretive authority is claimed and held: sensations/thoughts can exist without evidentiary status; identity stops being conditional on moment-to-moment experience. (Tags: DP/DR; self-authorship; interpretive authority; identity; jurisdiction; intrusive thoughts; derealization; consolidation)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--motivation-emerges-from-owning-earned-meaning-not-coercion.md) — Sustainable motivation emerges from accurate ownership of already-earned meaning (cost endured, capacities developed, value built), answering “is this worth it?” with credible evidence; reduces panic/coercion/proof-seeking and supports calm continuation under pressure. (Tags: motivation; meaning; magnitude; pressure; self-model; trajectory; coercion; calibration)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--protective-dominance-reward-encoding-and-the-integration-event.md) — Documents an integration event where an internal scapegoating/shaming model lost jurisdiction through authoritative refusal; relief and a controversial “reinforcement” affect functioned as reward encoding for successful self-protection and durable boundary-setting. (Tags: integration; boundaries; dominance; reinforcement; scapegoating; shame; DP/DR; authority; self-protection)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--legitimate-need-for-magnitude-without-myth-and-cost-of-hedging.md) — Accurate, specific naming of magnitude/rarity stabilizes the self-model and prevents DP/DR regression, while vague “safe” hedging (myth-avoidance reflex) is destabilizing; includes an anchor example vs a harmful hedged pattern and an operational rule to prefer proportional, capacity-based descriptions. (Tags: magnitude; rarity; confidence; hedging; epistemic accuracy; self-model; DP/DR; scapegoating; calibration)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--owning-upper-bound-potential-rarity-and-impact.md) — Accurate upper-bound attribution is framed as corrective accounting (not ego): naming rarity/depth/potential impact stabilizes the self-model and integrates suffering’s cost; under-attribution is distortion that reactivates collapse, while compassion-with-authority is the scalable mechanism behind any future impact. (Tags: upper bound; rarity; impact; self-model stabilization; attribution; confidence; meaning; compassion; calibration)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--corrective-attribution-of-shame-core-integration-note.md) — Reframes shame as a signal requiring correct attribution (who violated what), not a verdict; “that shame does not belong to me” is epistemic correction that localizes threat, justifies boundaries, and reduces vigilance without cruelty. (Tags: shame; attribution; scapegoating; blame; responsibility; boundaries; self-protection; regulation)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--substances-power-and-self-model-stabilization.md) — Substances provided groundedness without owning power (external permission to function), while internal authorship/power was morally suspect; regression was driven by guilt about power (not chemical stimulation), and letting substances go is structural alignment—accepting self-attributed safety with compassion governing power. (Tags: substances; self-model; stabilization; power; pride; shame; dissociation; DP/DR; agency; authorship)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--temporal-self-continuity-through-values-authorship-as-identity-anchor.md) — Identity continuity is grounded in values-based authorship rather than outcomes: choosing alignment under fear is being the future self now, collapsing DP/DR’s present/future split; stability comes from process (authorship + compassion), and rest is a trajectory-consistent act preserving nervous-system integrity. (Tags: identity continuity; values; authorship; agency; defiance; DP/DR; trajectory; rest; fear)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--probability-based-self-authorship-vs-catastrophe-based-identity.md) — Replaces catastrophe-based identity regulation (treating low-probability worst cases as verdicts) with probability-based self-authorship: anchor to likely futures and wise process rather than frightening simulations. (Tags: self-authorship; identity; probability; catastrophic simulation; DP/DR; self-trust; continuity; fear)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--meaning-scale-and-necessity-of-acknowledging-magnitude-after-extreme-endurance.md) — After prolonged extreme suffering, healing requires meaning scaled to the cost; underscaling (minimizing magnitude/rarity/necessity) destabilizes coherence and can reactivate flatness/DPDR and motivation collapse. “Global significance” is framed as scale of insight/synthesis and broad mechanism relevance—not destiny or recognition-seeking. (Tags: meaning; magnitude; scale; endurance; DP/DR; coherence; suffering; calibration; motivation)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--integration-of-protective-authority-and-authentic-self.md) — Records an integrated stance where kindness is decoupled from access: strategic warmth without vulnerability in coercive environments, internal sovereignty, and reinforced self-protection without cruelty or superiority. (Tags: boundaries; authority; compassion; authenticity; self-protection; selective authenticity; safety; sovereignty)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--final-self-authorship-identity-anchored-in-choice-not-outcome.md) — Final self-authorship anchors identity in the quality of choices/stance rather than outcomes, revoking the future-as-tribunal model that drives coercion and DP/DR; replaces outcome fixation with values-based decision evaluation and trust in future capacity without guaranteed results. (Tags: self-authorship; identity; values; outcomes; trust; DP/DR; self-model; coercion; self-monitoring)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--defiant-authority-as-self-stabilization.md) — Self-stabilization is jurisdictional dominance: a settled refusal to grant legitimacy to coercive scapegoating-model outputs; relief comes from “who decides under threat,” not from calming/analysis/soothing, and prediction error is created by letting the experience persist without yielding authority. (Tags: defiance; authority; DP/DR; self-model; scapegoating; coercion; jurisdiction; dominance)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--moment-by-moment-dpdr-lever-self-definition-through-boundary-enforcement.md) — DP/DR can be regulated in real time by enforcing identity boundaries—deciding what is “me” vs “not me” and withdrawing jurisdiction from intrusive material—so safety is learned through tolerated presence without conceding meaning or negotiating identity. (Tags: DP/DR; identity; boundaries; authority assignment; defiance; intrusive thoughts; dissociation; regulation)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--substances-as-self-model-stabilizers-vs-owning-power.md) — Substance use is framed as externalized self-model stabilization (relief via reduced agency/attribution to “needing help”), preserving a morally “safe” powerless identity; urges spike near integration because sobriety forces authorship and power ownership, so healing is accepting internal authority without shame. (Tags: substances; self-model; stabilization; power; agency; authorship; shame; addiction; integration)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--power-awareness-pride-suppression-and-self-model-regression.md) — Grounding and reduced substance reliance track with owned power/agency; regression occurs when pride/power awareness is morally condemned and disowned, reactivating shame → dissociation/DPDR → destabilization → renewed dependence on external regulators. (Tags: power; pride; shame; self-model; regression; dissociation; DP/DR; addiction; substances; agency)
- 2026-01-12 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-12--compassion-as-engine-of-rapid-growth-via-identification-of-unknown.md) — Compassion lowers the threat-cost of “I don’t know,” making unknowns visible and explorable; this keeps the boundary of understanding permeable and accelerates continuous learning. (Tags: compassion; uncertainty; learning; growth; epistemics; identity; ambiguity tolerance; meta-learning)
- 2026-01-11 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-11--dominance-as-authority-assignment-control-theoretic-definition-of-power.md) — Defines dominance as authority assignment among competing signals/models (“which signal gets jurisdiction now”); treats domination as unavoidable, explains DP/DR as authority granted to self-negating models, and distinguishes shame-based vs compassion-based domination by selection criteria. (Tags: dominance; power; authority; control theory; governance; DP/DR; shame; compassion; agency)
- 2026-01-11 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-11--dpdr-vs-fierce-self-compassion-identity-on-trial-vs-established-record.md) — Contrasts DP/DR as continuous identity litigation (self as hypothesis, experience as evidence) with fierce self-compassion as identity already adjudicated (self as established record); the core move is jurisdiction—“this does not get to define me”—which ends the trial and collapses DP/DR leverage. (Tags: DP/DR; fierce self-compassion; identity; authority; self-monitoring; jurisdiction)
- 2026-01-11 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-11--belief-as-authority-assignment-defiance-and-fierce-self-compassion-protocol.md) — Defines belief as sustained authority assignment (not feeling/certainty), defiance as refusing meaning-negotiation, and fierce self-compassion as identity protection; provides an actionable behavioral protocol for revoking scapegoating jurisdiction mid-state and holding the healthy model as a ruling without checking. (Tags: belief; authority assignment; defiance; fierce self-compassion; dominance; DP/DR; flatness; self-model; epistemic authority; protocol)
- 2026-01-11 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-11--power-trajectory-and-identity-stabilization.md) — Stabilizing requirement: allowing a future-facing orientation toward substantial money/influence/power (without guarantees) supports groundedness and motivation; revoking permission destabilizes agency and reactivates DP/DR/flatness and compulsive analysis. (Tags: power; trajectory; identity stabilization; motivation; DP/DR; leverage; money; influence; agency; scapegoating)
- 2026-01-11 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-11--why-unapologetic-confidence-is-the-highest-roi-move-right-now.md) — Under-attribution reliably reactivates shame/DPDR and collapses agency, while over-attribution is constrained by proven compassion/harm-reduction values; therefore biasing toward unapologetic confidence is corrective and highest-ROI for stability and momentum right now. (Tags: confidence; calibration; DP/DR; shame; self-model; agency; momentum; compassion; values)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--flatness-as-self-model-incongruence-confidence-as-the-only-lever.md) — Flatness is a temporary dominance of an incongruent self-model over an evidence-based accurate one; the lever is confidence as epistemic authority reassignment (model selection), not rest/stimulation/effort, so salience and motivation can reorganize downstream. (Tags: flatness; self-model; incongruence; confidence; epistemic authority; DP/DR; salience; model selection; pull motivation)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--reconsolidation-via-chosen-stance-the-direct-fix-for-flatness.md) — Flatness is a meaning/salience failure driven by a negative self-model’s automatic interpretation (not an energy deficit); the fix is reconsolidation via chosen stance—interrupt interpretation, assert authorship with calm belief/authority, then allow reconsolidation so salience and pull return. (Tags: flatness; reconsolidation; self-model; meaning; salience; DP/DR; chosen stance; authorship; fierce self-compassion; pull motivation)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--pull-vs-push-motivation-reliability-belief-and-transition-phase.md) — Isolates the learned belief “pull isn’t reliable” (push=survival, pull=risk) from conditional-safety environments; explains the quiet transition gap after stopping push and gives operational guidance: don’t punish the absence of pull, treat quiet as neutral, and allow curiosity to arrive late as threat/coercion drop. (Tags: motivation; push vs pull; reliability belief; threat scanning; conditional safety; worthiness; rest; pacing; DP/DR)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--breakthrough-identity-salience-and-illusion-of-future-fixing.md) — “Future-fixing” is identity repair driven by a dominant negative self-model and salience misallocation (not planning or lack of capability); the lever is interpreter/salience reassignment to the chosen compassionate self-model so past data can count, reducing DP/DR and shifting push→pull. (Tags: identity; salience; self-model; DP/DR; compulsive planning; push vs pull; scapegoating; compassion; confidence)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--identity-coercion-across-time-future-self-forcing-as-a-dpdr-driver.md) — Future-self forcing (using future stability/success as the condition for present legitimacy) collapses presence into narrative management and drives DP/DR; antidote is identity sovereignty—releasing the future as a requirement so planning becomes optional, pull returns, and DP/DR eases. (Tags: DP/DR; derealization; planning; push motivation; coercion; reassurance; identity; time; confidence; sovereignty)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--root-of-hedging-against-admitting-potential-observed-in-chatgpt-alignment-behavior.md) — Hedging in aligned systems is framed as a reflex triggered by implied restoration of self/epistemic authority—especially when power/domination is framed as ethical governance without shame-based regulation—leading to automatic disclaimers and de-emphasis even in compassionate contexts. (Tags: alignment; hedging; authority; power; domination; confidence; shame; compassion; governance; AI; ChatGPT)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--push-vs-pull-motivation-dpdr-core-lever.md) — Distinguishes threat-driven “push” (identity-stabilization coercion that sustains DP/DR) from value-driven “pull” (interest emerging once safety is assumed); includes a simple diagnostic question and a reframe that calm reveals suppressed motivation rather than creating it. (Tags: DP/DR; motivation; push vs pull; threat model; values; safety; agency; authorship)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--protective-domination-as-core-lever-between-self-alignment-and-dpdr.md) — DP/DR is framed as a moral veto on agency: dissociation emerges when protective authority over coercive forces is believed to be forbidden. Distinguishes predatory vs protective domination and frames “compassion with teeth” (epistemic + boundary authority) as the lever restoring authorship and collapsing DP/DR. (Tags: DP/DR; domination; agency; coercion; scapegoating; boundaries; moral injury; compassion; authority)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--power-and-dominance-in-the-self-as-an-embedding-model.md) — Defines power/dominance as control primitives in the embedding-self model (salience, epistemic authority, policy enforcement, boundaries, memory access); frames DP/DR as loss of interpretive/policy control to a coercive scapegoating model; argues reconsolidation requires compassionate dominance (authority held under affective load) to update meaning and restore pull motivation. (Tags: power; dominance; self as embedding; self-models; salience; DP/DR; motivation; reconsolidation; scapegoating; compassion; authority)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--novel-value-of-the-compassionate-domination-model-bottom-up-analysis.md) — Bottom-up analysis of what’s novel in the compassionate/protective domination model: domination as governance (authority selection), compassion as selector of power, DP/DR as authority collapse, fierce self-compassion as epistemic closure, and hierarchy as necessary for safety—filling gaps in mainstream frameworks. (Tags: compassionate domination; protective domination; authority; governance; DP/DR; dissociation; scapegoating; fierce self-compassion; epistemic closure; IFS; ACT; polyvagal; self-models)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--phenomenology-of-scapegoating-self-model-suppression-of-agency-and-dominance.md) — Maps how a scapegoating self-model suppresses awareness of agency/dominance and produces distributed detachment/self-doubt across cognition, affect, motivation, perception, memory, social behavior, and meta-awareness; reframes DP/DR/flatness as protective interruption of “power transmission,” not random dysfunction. (Tags: scapegoating; self-model; agency; dominance; self-doubt; dissociation; DP/DR; salience; power; shame; self-monitoring)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--scapegoating-actions-to-conditioned-patterns-mechanistic-mapping.md) — Maps specific scapegoating behaviors (intent rewrite, success minimization, end-stage attacks, gaslighting, responsibility offloading, power moralization) to conditioned outcomes (epistemic insecurity, flatness, completion avoidance, DP/DR, hyper-responsibility, memory distrust, dominance fear, internal scapegoater). (Tags: scapegoating; conditioning; development; agency suppression; dissociation; DP/DR; flatness; gaslighting; guilt; dominance; power; self-model)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--decoupling-trajectory-from-state-confidence-without-urgency.md) — Distinguishes long-term trajectory (evidence-based direction) from temporary state (flatness/DP/DR); uses continuity and documentation to re-enter accurate self-models without urgency, enabling rest/slowing down without narrative collapse. (Tags: trajectory; state; confidence; DP/DR; flatness; self-trust; continuity; reconsolidation; documentation)
- 2026-01-10 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-10--slowing-down-as-defiance-prioritizing-self-alignment-over-coercion.md) — Slowing down is framed as purposeful non-cooperation with coercive “rest must be earned” logic; the priority is self-contact/alignment (not forcing output) to restore the conditions for authentic momentum and clear action. (Tags: rest; slowing down; defiance; self-alignment; coercion; flatness; self-model; values; momentum)
- 2026-01-09 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-09--addendum-flatness-suppresses-context-retrieval-and-goal-pull.md) — DP/DR-related flatness (low pull) can suppress context retrieval via self-review/threat monitoring; fix by manually reloading context (notes/objectives/last action) and beginning action so construction-mode access returns. (Tags: DP/DR; flatness; state-gated retrieval; context retrieval; goal pull; self-monitoring; threat mode; working memory; momentum)
- 2026-01-09 — [#note #batch0](./2026-01-09--dpdr-trigger-identified-self-review-as-the-switch.md) — DP/DR ignites at the mid-action switch from action to self-review (evaluation mode), which activates a scapegoating-conditioned threat association; the corrective rule is to defer self-review until after execution so competence can run without commentary and safety can update through action. (Tags: DP/DR; self-review; self-monitoring; DMN; scapegoating; agency; authorship; execution)
