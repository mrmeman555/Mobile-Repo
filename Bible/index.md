## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-07 — [Asymmetric Stabilization via Lateral Alignment](./2026-01-07--asymmetric-stabilization-via-lateral-alignment.md) — Interaction tactic for high-control systems: briefly align with an existing identity/value anchor, displace critique onto an external target they already condemn, then exit—reducing volatility without accepting blame or erasing internal reality. (Tags: tactics; asymmetry; narcissism; OCPD; boundaries; self-protection)
- 2026-01-07 — [Identity Compression Token: “I’m Cool”](./2026-01-07--identity-compression-token-im-cool.md) — Captures an emergent integrated self-token (“I’m cool”) that compresses earned competence/values into a stable abstraction, reducing dp/dr fragmentation and shame speed by rejecting negative frames at the “whole self” level. (Tags: identity token; compression; self-model; consolidation; dp/dr)
- 2026-01-07 — [Satisfaction as the Marker of Correct Integration](./2026-01-07--satisfaction-as-the-marker-of-correct-integration.md) — Defines satisfaction as a stable, closing affect that emerges when values-aligned action is accurately owned (not minimized/dissociated), serving as somatic proof of correct integration and a “permission to rest” consolidation marker. (Tags: satisfaction; integration; ownership; values; consolidation; self-trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Competing-Frame Memory Consolidation (Post-Event Integration Method)](./2026-01-07--competing-frame-memory-consolidation-post-event-integration-method.md) — Post-event integration method: when confidence triggers threat retagging, add a coherent second stream (dignity/self-trust) during memory plasticity so consolidation encodes “confidence alongside fear; I remained whole” rather than “confidence = danger.” (Tags: consolidation; memory; frames; confidence; self-trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Overestimation of the “Next Thing” & the Behavioral Role of Confidence](./2026-01-07--overestimation-of-the-next-thing-and-the-behavioral-role-of-confidence.md) — Describes a threat-model distortion where the immediate next action is overweighted after progress, producing urgency and rest aversion; confidence as a chosen stance de-loads “the next thing” and allows consolidation to complete. (Tags: confidence; urgency; consolidation; rest; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Loving-Kindness as Self-Model Selection During Consolidation](./2026-01-07--loving-kindness-as-self-model-selection-during-consolidation.md) — Frames loving-kindness as permissive self-model selection during low-control consolidation windows: it biases the interpreter upstream of DMN meaning-making while avoiding monitoring/forcing, supporting continuity and DP/DR recovery via trust accumulation. (Tags: loving-kindness; self-model; consolidation; DMN; DP/DR; trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Loving-Kindness Affect as a Background Consolidation Signal](./2026-01-07--loving-kindness-affect-as-a-background-consolidation-signal.md) — Frames loving-kindness toward affect as background permission during consolidation: holding positive affect as allowed/safe without interrogation reduces monitoring and threat tagging, supporting coherence and countering dp/DR’s disbelief in felt-state legitimacy. (Tags: loving-kindness; affect; consolidation; permission; dp/dr)
- 2026-01-07 — [Memory Retagging During Rest (Write-Time Intervention)](./2026-01-07--memory-retagging-during-rest-write-time-intervention.md) — Treats rest as memory write-time: spontaneous recall is labile and gets reconsolidated with the active frame; use brief, confident retagging (capability/competence) to prevent shame-based self-doubt and stabilize ownership across time. (Tags: memory; reconsolidation; retagging; rest; self-trust; DP/DR)
- 2026-01-07 — [Operational Mastery Over Internal State Change](./2026-01-07--operational-mastery-over-internal-state-change.md) — Documents a transferable, compounding skill: real-time detection of active self-models, upstream lever selection, self-directed reconsolidation, and ambiguity tolerance until consolidation stabilizes. (Tags: self-model; reconsolidation; consolidation; metacognition; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [DP/DR Recovery as a Trust-and-Consolidation Process](./2026-01-07--dp-dr-recovery-as-a-trust-and-consolidation-process.md) — Frames DP/DR recovery as forward consolidation: trust is earned via repeated prediction→action→outcome alignment; reconsolidation prepares the ground but cannot substitute for real-time confirmation that your perspective holds across time. (Tags: DP/DR; trust; consolidation; reconsolidation; self-model)
- 2026-01-07 — [Relational Trust Revocation as a Direct Driver of DP/DR](./2026-01-07--relational-trust-revocation-as-a-direct-driver-of-dp-dr.md) — Frames dp/DR as protective disconnection when an attachment figure revokes trust without evidence, forcing an irreconcilable bind between internal continuity and external invalidation; recovery accelerates when trust is re-rooted internally and the mechanism is named. (Tags: DP/DR; attachment; trust; invalidation; self-model; dissociation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Acceptance Becomes Harder After Agency Is Discovered](./2026-01-07--acceptance-becomes-harder-after-agency-is-discovered.md) — Explains why acceptance feels harder after discovering effective levers: the system updates priors toward solvability, creating pressure to resolve; acceptance becomes strategic restraint and discernment about when non-intervention is the lever. (Tags: acceptance; agency; discernment; self-model; regulation; reconsolidation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Meta-Compression Through Values-First Exploration](./2026-01-07--meta-compression-through-values-first-exploration.md) — Values-first exploration creates meta-level coherence that collapses uncertainty across domains; alignment makes study purpose self-evident and reorganizes the “how” automatically. (Tags: coherence; values; alignment; meta-learning; studying; first principles; motivation)
- 2026-01-06 — [Turning Aversive Experience Into a Goal (Polarity Flip Mechanism)](./2026-01-06--turning-aversive-experience-into-a-goal-polarity-flip-mechanism.md) — Orientation sets meaning: avoidance reinforces negative self-models; deliberate approach from a compassionate model pre-empts threat labeling and breaks the prediction loop, turning aversion into integration data. (Tags: polarity flip; approach; avoidance; self-model; DMN; integration; meditation; exposure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Bible Note — Self-Model Regulation System (Behavioral Levers)](./2026-01-06--bible-note-self-model-regulation-system-behavioral-levers.md) — Procedural reference: select the interpreter (upstream belief), withdraw endorsement, install a truer perspective, and hold it over time; avoid fighting/monitoring which reinforces the wrong model. (Tags: self-model; regulation; belief; DMN; reconsolidation; interpretation; leverage; procedure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Withdrawal of Endorsement vs Denial — Reconsolidation Requires Replacement](./2026-01-06--withdrawal-of-endorsement-vs-denial-reconsolidation-requires-replacement.md) — “No” as withdrawal of endorsement stops reinforcing an interpretation, but reconsolidation requires installing and holding a coherent alternative frame so the old one becomes unnecessary. (Tags: belief; reconsolidation; interpretation; endorsement; replacement; self-model)
