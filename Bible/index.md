## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-07 — [DP/DR Recovery as a Trust-and-Consolidation Process](./2026-01-07--dp-dr-recovery-as-a-trust-and-consolidation-process.md) — Frames DP/DR recovery as forward consolidation: trust is earned via repeated prediction→action→outcome alignment; reconsolidation prepares the ground but cannot substitute for real-time confirmation that your perspective holds across time. (Tags: DP/DR; trust; consolidation; reconsolidation; self-model)
- 2026-01-07 — [Relational Trust Revocation as a Direct Driver of DP/DR](./2026-01-07--relational-trust-revocation-as-a-direct-driver-of-dp-dr.md) — Frames dp/DR as protective disconnection when an attachment figure revokes trust without evidence, forcing an irreconcilable bind between internal continuity and external invalidation; recovery accelerates when trust is re-rooted internally and the mechanism is named. (Tags: DP/DR; attachment; trust; invalidation; self-model; dissociation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Acceptance Becomes Harder After Agency Is Discovered](./2026-01-07--acceptance-becomes-harder-after-agency-is-discovered.md) — Explains why acceptance feels harder after discovering effective levers: the system updates priors toward solvability, creating pressure to resolve; acceptance becomes strategic restraint and discernment about when non-intervention is the lever. (Tags: acceptance; agency; discernment; self-model; regulation; reconsolidation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Meta-Compression Through Values-First Exploration](./2026-01-07--meta-compression-through-values-first-exploration.md) — Values-first exploration creates meta-level coherence that collapses uncertainty across domains; alignment makes study purpose self-evident and reorganizes the “how” automatically. (Tags: coherence; values; alignment; meta-learning; studying; first principles; motivation)
- 2026-01-06 — [Turning Aversive Experience Into a Goal (Polarity Flip Mechanism)](./2026-01-06--turning-aversive-experience-into-a-goal-polarity-flip-mechanism.md) — Orientation sets meaning: avoidance reinforces negative self-models; deliberate approach from a compassionate model pre-empts threat labeling and breaks the prediction loop, turning aversion into integration data. (Tags: polarity flip; approach; avoidance; self-model; DMN; integration; meditation; exposure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Bible Note — Self-Model Regulation System (Behavioral Levers)](./2026-01-06--bible-note-self-model-regulation-system-behavioral-levers.md) — Procedural reference: select the interpreter (upstream belief), withdraw endorsement, install a truer perspective, and hold it over time; avoid fighting/monitoring which reinforces the wrong model. (Tags: self-model; regulation; belief; DMN; reconsolidation; interpretation; leverage; procedure)
- 2026-01-06 — [Withdrawal of Endorsement vs Denial — Reconsolidation Requires Replacement](./2026-01-06--withdrawal-of-endorsement-vs-denial-reconsolidation-requires-replacement.md) — “No” as withdrawal of endorsement stops reinforcing an interpretation, but reconsolidation requires installing and holding a coherent alternative frame so the old one becomes unnecessary. (Tags: belief; reconsolidation; interpretation; endorsement; replacement; self-model)
