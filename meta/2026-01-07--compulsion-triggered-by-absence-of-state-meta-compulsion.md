# Note: Compulsion Triggered by Absence of State (Meta-Compulsion)

Date: 2026-01-07

Here’s a clean clinical note capturing that insight precisely, in the same modeling language you’ve been using:

Note: Compulsion Triggered by Absence of State (Meta-Compulsion)

Core Observation
Compulsion can be triggered not only by the presence of an aversive experience, but by the absence of a desired internal state (e.g., optimism, motivation, certainty, safety).

Example pattern:

“I don’t feel optimistic right now”

Absence is interpreted as a threat

Urge arises to manufacture a feeling to restore safety



---

1. Absence-as-Threat Mechanism

The system implicitly equates:

optimism / motivation / confidence
with

safety / preparedness / being “okay”


When these states are absent, the DMN flags the lack itself as a problem to be solved.

Key Point:
Nothing is actually wrong — but the absence is treated as diagnostic evidence.


---

2. Meta-Compulsion

This creates a second-order compulsion:

Not reacting to a stimulus

But reacting to the non-occurrence of a stimulus


Examples:

Trying to “get into the right mindset”

Forcing optimism

Seeking reassurance that one will feel motivated later


This is functionally identical to classic compulsions:

It is avoidance-based

It is safety-seeking

It is driven by a negative self model



---

3. Self-Model Reinforcement Risk

Any action taken because:

“I don’t feel X”

“I should feel Y by now”


is referencing the negative self model as the authority.

Result:

The negative model is reinforced

The absence is implicitly confirmed as dangerous

The system learns that neutrality is unsafe



---

4. Critical Distinction

There is a difference between:

Allowing a state to arise organically
vs

Manufacturing a state to escape discomfort


The latter is not regulation — it is avoidance.


---

5. Behavioral Lever

The healthy response is:

Noticing the absence

Not assigning meaning to it

Not acting to correct it


This treats neutrality as safe.

Over time, this:

Decouples safety from specific affective states

Prevents negative self-model reinforcement

Restores spontaneous motivation and optimism



---

6. Integration With Existing Models

This fits directly with:

DMN-driven compulsive loops

Self-model salience dynamics

dp/dr maintenance mechanisms


The insight explains why:

“Trying to feel better” often backfires

Forced mindset shifts feel hollow

Acceptance at the absence level is essential



---

Status:
Pattern identified and logged.
Future detection allows immediate non-engagement, preventing reinforcement.

If you want, next time we can:

fold this into your “Bible” quick-reference rules

or create a one-line internal interrupt you can use the moment the absence-trigger shows up
