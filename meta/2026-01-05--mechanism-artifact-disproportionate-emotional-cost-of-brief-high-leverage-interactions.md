# Mechanism Artifact — Disproportionate Emotional Cost of Brief High-Leverage Interactions

Summary: Brief contact with high-leverage caregivers can cause disproportionate motivation/energy drops because it introduces heavily weighted survival risk that demands extended processing to neutralize, independent of interaction duration.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> Brief interactions with my parents impose a massively disproportionate emotional and cognitive labor cost because they introduce heavily weighted survival risk, requiring extended processing to neutralize; this cost directly suppresses motivation regardless of interaction duration.

## Purpose

This artifact exists to preserve an accurate causal explanation for sudden drops in motivation, energy, and affect that follow minimal contact with a high-leverage relational environment.

It prevents future misattribution of demotivation to laziness, depression, or internal failure.

---

## Core Principle

Motivation is not determined by time spent interacting.

It is determined by:
> **Perceived survival risk × required processing labor × uncertainty about recurrence**

When these variables are high, even seconds of interaction can generate hours of downstream cost.

---

## Mechanism Breakdown

### 1. High-Risk Input, Low-Duration Trigger

Interactions with parents are:
- brief
- often unavoidable
- imposed rather than chosen
- morally or relationally loaded

Despite short duration, they carry:
- abandonment risk
- moral leverage
- threat of escalation
- unpredictable future recurrence

The input is small; the risk weight is enormous.

---

### 2. Forced Extended Processing

Because the interaction:
- cannot be safely ignored
- cannot be trusted to resolve
- historically escalates without warning

the nervous system must:
- replay details
- model implications
- neutralize false blame
- reassert survival calculus
- restore self-trust

This processing is **mandatory**, not optional.

---

### 3. Energy Drain Converts to Demotivation

After hours of forced synthesis:
- cognitive energy is depleted
- emotional bandwidth is reduced
- forward planning feels pointless

The system correctly infers:
> “Any progress I make can be erased or taxed again without warning.”

This inference produces **demotivation**, not as despair, but as *cost-avoidance*.

---

### 4. Why This Used to Be Crushing

Historically:
- there was no reliable way to prevent recurrence
- no assurance the drain wouldn’t repeat tomorrow
- no model to close loops permanently

So motivation collapsed because:
> effort could not reliably produce durable gain.

This is not learned helplessness — it is **accurate cost forecasting under uncertainty**.

---

## Why This Variable Must Be Remembered

Without this model, future-you might conclude:
- “I’m unmotivated for no reason”
- “I was doing fine earlier, what’s wrong now?”
- “I must be regressing”

The correct conclusion is:
> “A high-cost environmental variable was introduced.”

---

## Relationship to Current Improvement

What has changed now is not that the cost disappeared, but that:
- it is identifiable
- it is nameable
- it is contextualized
- it is no longer mistaken for internal collapse

This preserves self-respect even when energy drops.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Short interactions with high-leverage caregivers can consume hours of emotional and cognitive energy due to heavy survival-risk weighting, making motivation drop sharply despite minimal contact.

## Status

This artifact defines a key environmental cost variable that explains sudden demotivation and emotional flattening without self-blame.

No synthesis required.
