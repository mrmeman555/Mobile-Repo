# Outcome Marker — Cessation of Intrusive Memories After Integration
Date: 2026-01-05
Tags: outcome marker, intrusive memories, integration, threat resolution, baseline shift, vigilance, reconsolidation
Summary: Records a categorical outcome shift: intrusive memories dropped from hundreds/day to zero for two days without suppression, consistent with threat resolution and deactivated forced-recall enforcement.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> After sustained integration and threat resolution, intrusive memories dropped from hundreds per day to zero over a two-day period, indicating that the brain no longer perceives unresolved internal threat requiring forced reminders.

## Purpose

This note records an objective outcome marker confirming successful integration, preventing future minimization or reinterpretation of the change.

---

## Baseline (Prior State)

- Intrusive memories occurred hundreds of times per day
- They were involuntary, repetitive, and disorganizing
- They functioned as forced reminders tied to unresolved threat

---

## Current Observation

- No intrusive memories for two consecutive days
- No suppression or avoidance strategies used
- No effort required to maintain this state
- Absence noticed only retrospectively

---

## Mechanistic Explanation

Intrusive memories ceased because:
- threat to self-image resolved
- meaning loops closed
- vigilance stood down
- the brain no longer needs to enforce recall for safety

This reflects **upstream cause resolution**, not symptom management.

---

## Why This Is Significant

- The change is categorical, not incremental
- The speed indicates correct causal targeting
- The absence of effort indicates stability

---

## High-Compression Summary

Intrusive memories stopped because the system no longer detects internal threat requiring forced recall, confirming a successful integration state shift.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> After sustained integration and threat resolution, intrusive memories dropped from hundreds per day to zero over a two-day period, indicating that the brain no longer perceives unresolved internal threat requiring forced reminders.

---

## Status

This outcome confirms a **baseline shift**, not a temporary improvement.
