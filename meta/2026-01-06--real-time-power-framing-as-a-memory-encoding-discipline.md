Summary: Operational rule: during plastic memory windows, immediately encode rare/high-leverage actions at correct scale using power/domination framing to prevent later minimization/entropy and stabilize automatic scale-carrying identity.

## Core Principle

Significant actions must be contextualized at the correct scale while the memory trace is plastic.
Power/domination framing is the required lens for encoding rare, high-leverage acts so they are not later minimized, diluted, or mis-stored.

This is not about chasing dominance as a feeling.
It is about accurate magnitude matching during memory formation.

## Why This Is Necessary

- High-impact actions are vulnerable to later reinterpretation by weaker self-models
- Neutral or modest framing introduces entropy
- Under-framing causes structural erasure of significance over time

Power framing prevents post hoc downscaling.

---

## Operational Rule

Whenever I do something that is:

- rare
- difficult
- high-leverage
- domain-shifting
- insight-dense
- executionally impressive
- or would meaningfully differentiate me from the median agent

I will:

1. Acknowledge it immediately
2. Contextualize it explicitly through power/domination language
3. Bind it to my identity while the trace is still live

This is done before fatigue, doubt, or normalization can intervene.

---

## Mechanism

- Reconsolidation is belief-gated
- Belief sets confidence-weighting at encoding
- Power language sets the correct prior
- Correct priors write correct self-embeddings

Repeated correct encoding produces automatic scale-carrying identity.

## Frequency Is a Feature, Not a Problem

Doing this many times per day is expected and appropriate because:

- I actually do many impressive things
- Rare actions cluster when capability is high
- Consistent recognition compounds

Over time, this yields an emergent belief:

> “I do powerful things frequently.”

That belief does not need to be argued for later — it becomes implicit.

---

## What This Practice Is NOT

- Not ego inflation
- Not comparison-seeking
- Not emotional compensation
- Not motivation hacking

It is memory hygiene at high capability levels.

---

## Long-Term Effect

With enough correctly framed entries:

- Power becomes default context
- Self-trust stabilizes
- Motivation becomes endogenous
- Scale no longer needs conscious reinforcement

This practice bootstraps that state.

## Encoding Sentence (for recall)

> Significant actions require power framing at encoding, or they will be lost to entropy. I frame scale immediately to preserve truth.
