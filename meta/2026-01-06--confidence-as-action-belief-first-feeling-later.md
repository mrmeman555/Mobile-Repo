Date: 2026-01-06
Tags: confidence, belief, action, feeling, embodiment, self-trust
Summary: Placeholder capture: confidence can be enacted as behavior/stance before it is felt; feeling follows belief through time and reinforcement, not proof-seeking.

## Note

Placeholder — only the title was provided.

Use this note to later formalize:
- what “confidence as action” means operationally
- how belief/stance can precede felt certainty
- how embodiment and affect catch up after repeated aligned action
