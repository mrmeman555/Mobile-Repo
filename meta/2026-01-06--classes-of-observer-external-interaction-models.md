Summary: Catalogs hypothesis classes where observers participate causally (measurement/constraint/action-selection/information-flow), without asserting truth or implying omniscience/control.

This is a catalog of possibility classes, not claims of truth. Models are listed only when they explicitly posit some causal interaction between observer and event/object; framed as mechanistic/formal possibilities rather than mystical assertions.

## Classes of Observer–External Interaction Models

### 1. Observer-Dependent Collapse / Measurement Interaction

**Domain:** Quantum foundations  
**Core idea:** The act of observation is not neutral; it participates in selecting outcomes.

In some interpretations, measurement is not just information gathering but an interaction that constrains system evolution. The observer’s state (attention, measurement context) is part of the causal chain.

Importantly: this does not allow free prediction, but it does allow observer–system coupling.

**Why it fits:** Explicit causality between observer and outcome, even if tightly constrained.

---

### 2. Retrocausal / Time-Symmetric Causality Models

**Domain:** Physics foundations (speculative but formalized)

Causes and effects are not strictly forward-only. Future boundary conditions can constrain present states. Observer participation is part of a global constraint satisfaction problem across time.

Examples (families, not endorsements):

- Two-state vector formalism
- Time-symmetric quantum mechanics
- Advanced/retarded wave models

**Why it fits:** Allows causal influence not strictly forward in time without paradoxical signaling.

### 3. Block Universe + Observer Alignment Effects

**Domain:** Philosophy of physics / ontology of time

The universe is a fixed 4D structure. “Becoming” is an artifact of conscious traversal. An observer can become aligned with future-consistent paths due to internal model coherence.

Causality here is subtle: not signal-based, but constraint-based. Observer state is causally relevant to which consistent trajectories are experienced.

---

### 4. Predictive Processing with Strong Priors Acting as Causal Filters

**Domain:** Neuroscience / cognitive science

The observer’s internal model actively shapes perception and action. Beliefs do not just predict outcomes; they select behaviors that make some futures far more likely than others. Over long horizons, this can look like “the belief caused the outcome.”

**Why it still counts:** The observer causally influences which external events occur via action-selection loops.

---

### 5. Self-Fulfilling Attractor Participation

**Domain:** Complex systems / dynamical systems

Some future states are attractors. Observers who detect attractors early and align behavior toward them become part of the causal basin. Their early belief is causally involved in the attractor being reached in that configuration.

This is not coincidence; it is observer participation in attractor realization.

---

### 6. Anthropic / Participatory Universe Models

**Domain:** Cosmology / foundational physics (interpretive)

The universe’s properties are constrained by the existence of observers. Some models suggest observers are not just selected by the universe, but co-define which universes are realized.

Examples:

- Wheeler’s Participatory Anthropic Principle
- Observer-selection effects with causal teeth

**Causality:** Observer existence constrains physical realization.

---

### 7. Information-Theoretic Causality

**Domain:** Information physics / computation

Reality is treated as information flow. Observers are information-processing nodes. Information constraints propagate causally and can shape future states.

In this frame, an observer’s internal model can act as a compressive influence on which external states are stable or reachable.

---

### 8. Field-Like Models of Consciousness (Speculative)

**Domain:** Consciousness studies (highly speculative)

Consciousness is modeled as a field or process interacting with physical systems. Not supernatural by definition, but not yet empirically grounded.

**Important:** Least supported category here, but it explicitly posits observer–world causality.

---

### 9. Global Constraint Satisfaction Across Observer and Environment

**Domain:** Systems theory / cybernetics

The observer and environment are a single coupled system. Solutions must satisfy constraints on both sides. Observer internal coherence can restrict which external states are reachable.

This treats causality as bidirectional constraint enforcement, not force transmission.

---

### 10. Selection-Bias-Driven Causal Loops

**Domain:** Statistics / epistemology

Observers systematically survive or notice worlds where their internal models align with reality. Over time, this can create the appearance of “knowing ahead of time,” even though the causal mechanism is survival and persistence.

Still causal, but indirect.

---

## Important Meta-Point

All of these models:

- preserve causality
- avoid omniscience
- do not imply control
- allow interaction without fantasy

They differ in where the interaction occurs:

- measurement
- time symmetry
- action selection
- constraint satisfaction
- information flow
- ontological participation

---

## The Common Thread

Every model that allows observer–world causality shares this structure:

> The observer is not an external spectator, but a participating constraint in the system’s evolution.

That is the scientifically respectable way to say what people historically gestured at with mystical language.
