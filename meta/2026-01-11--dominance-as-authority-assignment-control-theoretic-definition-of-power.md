# Dominance as Authority Assignment — A Control-Theoretic Definition of Power

Summary: Defines dominance as the irreducible act of authority assignment among competing signals/models (“which signal gets jurisdiction now”); frames domination as unavoidable, explains DP/DR as authority granted to self-negating models, and distinguishes shame-based vs compassion-based domination by selection criteria rather than operation.

## Core definition (foundational)

Dominance = the act of granting authority to one of multiple competing interests or signals.

This is the irreducible, structural definition.
Not metaphorical. Not moral. Not theatrical.

Dominance is not force, cruelty, suppression, or aggression.
Those are methods that may appear when authority is contested.

At the base layer, dominance is simply:

> Which signal gets jurisdiction right now.

If I am the one assigning jurisdiction, then I am the one dominating — regardless of tone, emotion, or intent.


---

## Why this definition matters

This framing resolves confusion that many psychological, spiritual, and therapeutic models leave vague or avoid.

Many models talk about:

- “letting go”
- “allowing”
- “acceptance”
- “non-resistance”

But they fail to answer the critical question:

> Who decides?

This definition makes the answer explicit:

> The self assigns authority. Always.

When this is unclear or denied, domination still occurs — but unconsciously, by default, and often in harmful directions.


---

## Control-theoretic implications

Under this model:

- domination is unavoidable
- authority is always being assigned
- the only variable is which model receives it and why

Avoiding “domination” does not remove power.
It merely hands authority to the loudest, most coercive signal.

This explains:

- why shame dominates when unchallenged
- why dissociation emerges when authority assignment collapses
- why DP/DR occurs when authority is granted to a self-negating model

## Shame-based vs compassion-based domination

Both shame and compassion dominate via the same operation:

> Authority assignment

The difference lies entirely in selection criteria.

### Shame-based domination

Authority is granted to signals that claim:

- moral superiority
- threat
- condemnation

Power is stabilized by attributing value to being “right” or “pure.”
Identity is protected by projecting or internalizing shame.

### Compassion-based domination

Authority is granted to signals aligned with:

- values
- coherence
- long-term reduction of suffering

Power is stabilized by regulating shame without attribution.
Identity is protected through choice, not moral inflation.

Both dominate.
Only one does so sustainably.

## Relation to DP/DR and trauma

This model cleanly explains DP/DR:

- DP/DR = authority given to a model that negates or erases the self
- recovery = reasserting authority consciously
- confidence exposure = deliberately assigning jurisdiction to the healthy self-model

When authority assignment becomes clear and stable, the system settles.

This also explains why dominance can feel primal: at that layer, the nervous system is not asking:

- “What is kind?”
- “What is correct?”

It is asking:

> Who decides?

Once that question is answered, regulation follows.

## Dangerousness reframed

“Dangerousness” is not immorality.
It is awareness of one’s capacity to assign authority in the face of resistance.

Quiet, calm authority can be profoundly powerful.
Coercive authority feels powerful but is unstable.

Same operation.
Different ethics.

Avoiding acknowledgment of dangerousness does not make a person safer — it makes them blind to what already governs them.


---

## Bottom line

- dominance = authority assignment
- domination = choosing which model governs experience
- everyone dominates constantly
- the ethical question is how consciously and compassionately

This framing:

- removes moral mysticism
- aligns with neuroscience and trauma theory
- explains DP/DR without pathology inflation
- restores agency without denial
- makes compassion an active force, not a passive one

Responsibility belongs exactly where it should:

> With the chooser.

And clarity at this layer is not optional — it is stabilizing.
