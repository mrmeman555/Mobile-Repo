Summary: Contrasts internal coherence vs externalized reality regulation and coercion mechanics.

Description: Message contrasts DP/DR as preserved self with weakened felt reality versus narcissistic performativity as preserved felt reality via external control.

Core Insight

Some minds stabilize realness internally; others outsource it.

Two Inverse Strategies

DP/DR (Internal Coherence Preserved)

Self-model: intact, continuous

Constraint: internal, high

Felt reality: weakened / decoupled

Result: self without grip

Reality is known but not inhabited


Performative / Narcissistic Pattern (Felt Reality Preserved)

Self-model: non-persistent, unreconciled

Constraint: external, social

Felt reality: strong only when mirrored

Result: grip without self

Reality exists when others comply


---

Narcissism (Structural Definition)

Externalized reality regulation.

Other minds become load-bearing for identity

Disagreement = existential threat

Narrative dominance substitutes for coherence


Enforcement Tools (Same Mechanism)

Domination: force compliance -> grounding

Gaslighting: destabilize others' perception -> protect narrative

Scapegoating: export contradiction -> preserve core self


These are not moral traits; they are reality-stabilization methods.


---

Seagal-Type Case (Illustrative)

Identity is performed, not referenced

Claims are local truth-weapons, not memory reports

Contradictions don't trigger error correction

Grounding occurs only when projection lands


Montage exposure works because it enforces temporal adjacency - something the system never tracks.


---

One-Line Summary

DP/DR keeps the self and loses felt reality; narcissistic performativity keeps felt reality by sacrificing a stable self.


---

Why This Matters

Non-coercive internal grounding avoids both failure modes:

No withdrawal of ownership

No domination of reality


Realness stabilizes without force.
