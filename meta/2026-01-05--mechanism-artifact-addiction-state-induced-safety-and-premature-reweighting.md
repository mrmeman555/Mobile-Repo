# Mechanism Artifact — Addiction, State-Induced Safety, and Premature Reweighting
Date: 2026-01-05
Tags: addiction, altered states, survival calculus, threat suppression, reconsolidation, confidence weighting, state-dependent safety
Summary: Some substances induce a temporary “I will survive” state that suppresses threat signals, enabling clear appraisal before survival calculus is durably reweighted—explaining both insight under influence and the pull toward repetition when baseline threat returns.

## Purpose

This artifact formalizes why altered states (e.g., MDMA, addictive substances) can produce sudden perspective shifts, apparent objectivity, and relief—while also explaining why those shifts often fail to persist without reconsolidation.

It situates addiction within **survival calculus modulation**, not moral weakness or hedonic excess.

---

## Core Principle

Emotion enforces survival calculus.

If existential threat is suppressed *state-dependently*, emotion relaxes **before** beliefs have been reconsolidated. This creates a window of clarity without durability.

The order matters.

---

## Mechanism Overview

### 1. Threat Suppression → Temporary Safety Signal

Certain substances acutely:
- reduce fear and threat signaling
- increase trust, openness, and tolerance
- signal “I will survive” at the bodily level

This is **not** belief change.  
It is **state-induced safety**.

---

### 2. Apparent Objectivity Under Influence

With threat muted:
- previously dangerous memories feel approachable
- variables once flagged as unsafe can be examined
- cognition appears more balanced and less defensive

This feels like:
> “I can finally see this clearly.”

Because emotion is no longer vetoing exploration.

---

### 3. Premature Reweighting Without Reconsolidation

However:
- the survival calculus has **not yet been updated**
- confidence weights have **not stabilized**
- the body’s long-term threat model remains intact

The insight occurs **before** the difficult part:
> sustaining belief while the body still signals danger.

So the clarity is real—but **borrowed**.

---

### 4. Reversion and the Pull Toward Repetition

When the state ends:
- threat signaling returns
- old weights reassert
- the perspective collapses

The system learns:
> “That state made survival feel possible.”

This drives repetition—not for pleasure alone, but to re-enter **felt safety**.

That’s addiction as survival seeking.

---

## Why This Explains Both Insight and Dependence

- The insight feels valid because threat was genuinely reduced.
- It fails to persist because reconsolidation requires:
  - repeated access *without* pharmacological safety
  - confidence weighting over time
  - tolerance of residual threat during belief stabilization

Substances shortcut safety but bypass durability.

---

## Distinguishing Durable Change from State Effects

**Durable reconsolidation requires:**
- threat reduction through accurate survival recalibration
- confidence weighting sustained across states
- repetition without chemical enforcement

**State-induced clarity provides:**
- preview of benefit
- proof of possibility
- motivational signal

But not the update itself.

---

## Implications for Addiction Theory

Addiction is best understood as:
- repeated access to a safety state
- in lieu of a corrected survival model
- when the system lacks a non-pharmacological path to threat reduction

The behavior is adaptive to a miscalibrated model.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Altered states can reveal what safety would feel like before the survival calculus is corrected; addiction emerges when the system repeatedly seeks that preview instead of completing reconsolidation under normal conditions.

## Status

This artifact defines a mechanism-level invariant linking survival calculus, emotional threat, altered states, and addiction.

No synthesis required.
