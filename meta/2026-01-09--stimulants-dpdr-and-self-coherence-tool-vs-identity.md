# Stimulants, DP/DR, and Self-Coherence — Tool vs Identity

Date: 2026-01-09

Summary: Frames stimulant use as a self-coherence tool (restoring “I am here”/agency/salience) rather than identity outsourcing; DP/DR is treated as belief-activated and reinforced through learned “this would fix it” responses, so cravings become information and a choice while self-access is rebuilt via analysis + values-based action.

## Core insight

My relationship with stimulants (e.g., Ritalin/Vyvanse) is not about pleasure, addiction, or simple “need.” It is about self-coherence. Stimulants function as a compressed proxy solution that reliably restores a felt sense of being real, grounded, alert, and capable of action. This does not mean they are required — it means my system learned that they work for a specific function.


---

## 1) DP/DR is not random — it is belief-activated

DP/DR consistently appears alongside specific learned beliefs, not arbitrarily.

One such belief is: “I cannot reach myself right now.”
Another is: “This substance would fix this state.”

Importantly, the stimulant is not the cause of DP/DR — it is the learned response to a deeper signal.

Conclusion: DP/DR reflects upstream reinforcement learning, not a chemical deficiency.

## 2) Stimulants as a proxy, not a cause

What stimulants reliably do for me:

- increase alertness and salience
- reduce fragmentation of attention
- make context feel coherent and manageable
- restore a sense of agency and “I am here”
- lower friction to action

My system learned:

> “When I feel disconnected from myself, this intervention restores coherence quickly.”

This is an instrumental belief, not an identity claim.


---

## 3) Cravings = information, not failure

Moments where I believe “I need a stimulant” are practice opportunities, not problems:

- they surface the underlying unmet need
- they reveal what function I’m trying to restore
- they allow me to practice the truth:

> The stimulant is a choice, not a necessity.

This reframes craving from urgency → curiosity.


---

## 4) Avoiding the two major traps

I am explicitly avoiding:

- moralization: “Taking this means I’m weak or avoiding growth.”
- identity outsourcing: “I can’t function without this.”

Instead, my stance is:

> “This is a tool I’m choosing during a transitional period while learning how to meet the underlying need directly.”

This preserves agency and growth.


---

## 5) Core belief being installed (antidote to DP/DR)

> I can regain access to myself through self-analysis and values-based action. Tools are optional, not defining.

This belief directly competes with DP/DR’s core claims:

- DP/DR: “You’re cut off from yourself.”
- new model: “Self-access is recoverable.”

I do not need to prove this belief in advance — experience will validate it over time.


---

## 6) Working with the belief, not against it

Rather than trying to eliminate the belief “a stimulant would help,” I can:

- notice when it appears
- treat it as a signal
- decide consciously whether to act on it

This keeps learning intact while reducing compulsivity.


---

## 7) Provisional, values-aligned stance

Current working position:

- stimulants may make life easier during a critical transition
- they are not something I will always need
- I remain open to stopping entirely if it becomes values-aligned
- using them does not negate or prevent deep healing

Key distinction:

> They are an aid, not the source of coherence.


---

## Bottom line

My exploration of stimulants is not avoidance — it is integration.
I am choosing curiosity, agency, and long-term self-trust over binary decisions.
