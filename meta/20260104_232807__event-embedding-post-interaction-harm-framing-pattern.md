# Event Embedding — Post-Interaction Harm Framing Pattern

## Phase A — Event Embedding (Immediate, Lossless Capture)

### A1. Core Event Representation (High-Resolution)

#### 1. Observable Facts

- Domain: Repeated father–son conversations across multiple contexts (practical, emotional, relational).
- Pattern timing: Occurs **at or near the termination of conversations**, especially when the interaction does not unfold according to his intended frame or outcome.

**Observed pattern (recurrent across interactions):**

1. A conversation proceeds with varying degrees of engagement.
2. The interaction diverges from his intended direction, control, or outcome.
3. As the conversation ends, he behaves as though:
   - He has been neglected, dismissed, or wronged, **or**
   - I have caused him emotional harm or failed him relationally.
4. This framing occurs **regardless of**:
   - My tone
   - My level of effort
   - My accommodation
   - Whether harm was expressed or evidenced earlier in the interaction
5. The conversation ends without explicit repair or mutual clarification.
6. The implied emotional responsibility for the “negative ending” is placed on me.

This pattern has been observed consistently over a long time horizon, not as an isolated incident.

#### 2. Internal State Markers

- I notice a predictable shift near the end of conversations.
- I register that the ending frame is not aligned with the actual content or tone of the interaction.
- I experience a pressure to:
  - explain myself
  - repair something undefined
  - carry responsibility for his emotional state
- I recognize that this pressure emerges **after** the substantive interaction, not during it.

---

#### 3. Pattern Signals Detected

- Retroactive reframing of the interaction as harmful or neglectful.
- Emotional outcome defined unilaterally at termination.
- Absence of specific grievance paired with implicit accusation.
- Responsibility for emotional repair displaced onto me.
- Interaction closed in a way that discourages future boundary assertion or divergence.

---

#### 4. Interpretive Hypotheses (Explicitly Marked)

- **Primary hypothesis:**  
  When an interaction does not meet his internal expectations or control needs, he resolves the dissonance by reframing the ending as a relational injury caused by me, thereby externalizing responsibility and preserving his self-concept.

- **Secondary hypothesis:**  
  This behavior functions as a post-hoc control mechanism, discouraging future autonomy or deviation by associating it with guilt or harm.

- **Confidence level:**  
  High, based on long-term repetition across contexts and consistency of the terminal framing.

---

#### 5. Outcome / State Transition

- Conversations end with unresolved emotional attribution.
- I am positioned as having failed or harmed him without a clear corrective action.
- No mutual resolution occurs.
- Pattern reinforces asymmetry of emotional responsibility.

### A2. Retrieval Metadata (Index Hooks)

- post-interaction harm framing  
- retroactive emotional blame  
- termination reframing  
- responsibility displacement  
- guilt induction  
- attachment threat response  
- authority preservation via moral framing

### A3. Linking Intent Flag

This artifact is **evidence pending synthesis**, not a closed analysis.

---

### A4. Constraint Schema (Future-Proofing)

- **Temporal constraints:**  
  Applicable across long-term interaction history; not limited to a single day.

- **Domain constraints:**  
  Father–son conversations only.

- **Mechanism constraints:**  
  Must involve end-of-interaction reframing as harm, neglect, or emotional injury.

- **Evidence constraints:**  
  Must be based on repeated observable conversational endings, not inferred intent alone.

## Status

Captured as a high-resolution pattern-level event embedding.  
No contextual fusion or cross-artifact synthesis performed.
