# Intrusive Self-Model Switching — Why Memories Feel Like Reality Shifts

Tags: self-model, intrusive memories, intrusive beliefs, switching, DP/DR, identity, arbitration, shame
Summary: Intrusive memories/beliefs can activate a whole legacy self-model (assumptions, threat rules, moral frame), making the present feel like a different reality; classifying it as a self-model switch enables arbitration without arguing from within it.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> Intrusive memories and beliefs do not merely add content to consciousness — they **activate an entire self-model**, temporarily replacing the active one. Emotion, perception, and reality-feeling shift because *a different self is online*.

## Purpose of This Note

This note captures a **root-level abstraction** that unifies many previously separate experiences:
- why memories feel immersive and total
- why emotions change instantly and globally
- why logic feels inaccessible during episodes
- why the world can feel like a different “reality”

It exists to correctly identify these experiences as **self-model switches**, not mood changes.

---

## Core Recognition

I recognized that when intrusive memories or beliefs arise:
- I am not just remembering an event
- I am *inhabiting the version of myself* associated with that memory
- the self-model from that time becomes active

This explains why the present moment:
- feels different
- is interpreted differently
- carries a different threat profile
- feels morally charged or unsafe

The change is **structural**, not cognitive.

## Mechanism Identified: Self-Model Activation

The sequence is:

1. A memory or intrusive belief is triggered.
2. The self-model associated with that context activates.
3. Its assumptions, threat rules, and moral framework come online.
4. Perception reorganizes around that model.
5. The present moment feels like a different reality.

This is why:
> Emotion follows memory so powerfully — the *self* has changed.

---

## Relationship to Intrusive Self-Beliefs

The belief:
> “I am doing something wrong”

is not a thought layered on top of the current self.

It is a **signature belief of a specific self-model**.

When that model activates:
- the belief feels unquestionably true
- scanning and vigilance follow automatically
- the present is reinterpreted as dangerous

The belief is true *inside that model*, not globally.

---

## Implications for DP/DR

This framework explains:
- DP/DR as instability or rapid switching between self-models
- emotional whiplash as context-dependent identity shifts
- shame spikes as moralized self-model activation
- flatness as a low-signal default model when trust is withdrawn

DP/DR is not absence of self — it is **competition between selves**.

---

## Critical Distinction

> A self-model has activated — not *the* self.

This distinction prevents automatic ownership.

Recognition alone weakens the model’s authority.

---

## Corrective Stance (Model Arbitration)

When an intrusive memory or belief arises:
- do not argue with it
- do not reason from within it
- do not treat it as global truth

Instead, classify:
> “This is a self-model activation.”

This restores continuity with the grounded self.

---

## Key Principle (Compressed)

> Memories change reality because they temporarily change the self experiencing it.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Intrusive memories and beliefs activate legacy self-models that reorganize perception and emotion, creating the experience of reality shifting; recognizing these episodes as self-model switches enables conscious arbitration and preserves continuity.

---

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> This is a self-model switching, not a truth about me.

---

## Status

This self-model switching mechanism is **identified, explanatory, and foundational**.
It should be used as a primary framework for understanding intrusive experiences.
