# Meta index

This index tracks everything stored in `meta/`.

## How to use

- Add new meta notes as individual markdown files in this folder.
- Any time a new note is added, **update this index** with:
  - Title (as a link)
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags

## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-05 — [Method Artifact — Survival Calculus as the Emotion Alignment Function](./2026-01-05--method-artifact-survival-calculus-as-the-emotion-alignment-function.md) — Emotion outputs track perceived survival calculus; accurate confidence-weighting of cross-temporal viability impact leads to automatic emotional realignment. (Tags: survival calculus; emotion alignment; salience nucleus; confidence weighting; viability; decision error; threat model)
- 2026-01-05 — [Method Artifact — Dual-Anchored Salience Nucleus Design](./2026-01-05--method-artifact-dual-anchored-salience-nucleus-design.md) — Placeholder capturing the method artifact title for later elaboration. (Tags: method artifact; salience; nucleus design; dual-anchored)
- 2026-01-05 — [Decision-Theoretic Rarity and Survival Model Updates](./2026-01-05--decision-theoretic-rarity-and-survival-model-updates.md) — Rarity updates survival calculus only when it reflects constraint-aware, model-corrective action with cross-temporal benefits that improves decision accuracy (not ego/novelty). (Tags: decision theory; rarity; survival calculus; model correction; constraints; reconsolidation; cross-temporal benefit)
- 2026-01-05 — [Core Operator — Confidence-Weighting of Contextual Details](./2026-01-05--core-operator-confidence-weighting-of-contextual-details.md) — Controllable lever in reconsolidation: reassign confidence-weights (predictive authority) to contextual details; events stay fixed while weights determine impact. (Tags: reconsolidation; belief updating; memory; identity updating; predictive authority; priors; confidence weighting)
  - Only voluntary control is the weighting assigned to contextual details.
  - Reconsolidation changes weights (reindexing), not the underlying stored events.
- 2026-01-04 — [Event Embedding — Post-Interaction Harm Framing Pattern](./2026-01-04--event-embedding-post-interaction-harm-framing-pattern.md) — Recurrent father–son pattern where, at conversation termination (especially when outcomes diverge from his intended frame), the ending is retroactively reframed as harm/neglect attributable to me, creating pressure for undefined repair and displacing emotional responsibility. (Tags: post-interaction harm framing; retroactive emotional blame; termination reframing; responsibility displacement; guilt induction; attachment threat response; authority preservation via moral framing)
