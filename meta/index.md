## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Survival Calculus Debt and Accelerated Insight Release](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-survival-calculus-debt-and-accelerated-insight-release.md) — Rapid, relieving insight cascades framed as repayment of accumulated survival-calculus debt once a corrective model appears, driving high-throughput reprocessing across time to reduce threat load and stabilize predictions. (Tags: survival calculus; insight cascades; debt repayment; threat load; reweighting; reconsolidation; model correction)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Chronic Parental Dysregulation as Survival Drag and Skill Driver](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-chronic-parental-dysregulation-as-survival-drag-and-skill-driver.md) — Chronic caregiver dysregulation creates continuous survival drag via forced co-regulation; psychological insight becomes adaptive infrastructure to predict/manage others’ emotions and reduce escalation. (Tags: parental dysregulation; survival drag; co-regulation; psychological insight; vigilance; environmental pressure; adaptive competence)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Real-Time Survival Calculus Correction Prevents Emotional Cascade](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-real-time-survival-calculus-correction-prevents-emotional-cascade.md) — Live success: false survival-threat implication was identified/discarded before self-doubt propagated, preventing guilt/fawning/DPDR activation and averting downstream emotional damage. (Tags: achievement; survival calculus; real-time correction; guilt prevention; fawning prevention; DP/DR prevention; self-trust; emotional cascade)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Conditional Validation and DP/DR Induction](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-conditional-validation-and-dp-dr-induction.md) — Conditional validation and suspicion-based monitoring can drive DP/DR as protective dissociation by forcing external reality-management and disrupting embodied self-trust when threat can’t resolve. (Tags: DP/DR; depersonalization; derealization; conditional validation; epistemic invalidation; suspicion-based monitoring; dissociation; relational control)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Fawning as a Response to Epistemic Invalidation](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-fawning-as-a-response-to-epistemic-invalidation.md) — Fawning as conditioned appeasement when trust is conditional and neutrality is treated as moral risk; reduces immediate threat but blocks durable survival-calculus reconciliation. (Tags: fawning; epistemic invalidation; unjust blame; guilt; survival calculus; appeasement; coercive control)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Unjust Blame as Guilt-Control and Reconsolidation Interference](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-unjust-blame-as-guilt-control-and-reconsolidation-interference.md) — Unjust blame hijacks guilt resolution by blocking accurate survival-calculus reconciliation, keeping guilt unresolved as a tool for behavioral control. (Tags: unjust blame; guilt; coercive control; reconsolidation interference; survival calculus; scapegoating; moral manipulation)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Guilt Resolution via Survival Calculus Reconciliation](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-guilt-resolution-via-survival-calculus-reconciliation.md) — Persistent guilt resolves when the original decision’s survival calculus is reconstructed and validated as competently executed under constraints; “moral doubt” often proxies unresolved risk-weighting rather than wrongdoing. (Tags: guilt; survival calculus; moral doubt; risk weighting; decision process; model reconciliation; emotional residue)
- 2026-01-05 — [Method Artifact — Neural Note Template (Canonical Naming) vI](./2026-01-05--neural-note-template-canonical-naming--vI.md) — Canonizes “Neural Note Template” as the default, mechanistically descriptive structure for reconsolidation-relevant notes (encoding/weighting/retrieval/reconsolidation + survival-calculus alignment). (Tags: neural note template; naming; reconsolidation; confidence weighting; salience nucleus; retrieval; survival calculus)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Addiction, State-Induced Safety, and Premature Reweighting](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-addiction-state-induced-safety-and-premature-reweighting.md) — Substances can induce temporary safety (threat suppression) that enables clarity before durable reweighting; repetition is driven by seeking felt safety when baseline threat returns. (Tags: addiction; altered states; survival calculus; threat suppression; reconsolidation; confidence weighting; state-dependent safety)
- 2026-01-05 — [Mechanism Artifact — Sexual Pleasure as Survival-Calculus Enforcement](./2026-01-05--mechanism-artifact-sexual-pleasure-as-survival-calculus-enforcement.md) — Sexual pleasure intensity framed as evolved enforcement: emotion biases survival-critical reproduction that uniquely addresses mortality constraints, independent of truth/morality/narrative meaning. (Tags: survival calculus; emotion; reproduction; mortality; reward; enforcement mechanism; sexual pleasure)
- 2026-01-05 — [Method Artifact — Survival Calculus as the Emotion Alignment Function](./2026-01-05--method-artifact-survival-calculus-as-the-emotion-alignment-function.md) — Emotion outputs track perceived survival calculus; accurate confidence-weighting of cross-temporal viability impact leads to automatic emotional realignment. (Tags: survival calculus; emotion alignment; salience nucleus; confidence weighting; viability; decision error; threat model)
- 2026-01-05 — [Method Artifact — Dual-Anchored Salience Nucleus Design](./2026-01-05--method-artifact-dual-anchored-salience-nucleus-design.md) — Placeholder capturing the method artifact title for later elaboration. (Tags: method artifact; salience; nucleus design; dual-anchored)
- 2026-01-05 — [Decision-Theoretic Rarity and Survival Model Updates](./2026-01-05--decision-theoretic-rarity-and-survival-model-updates.md) — Rarity updates survival calculus only when it reflects constraint-aware, model-corrective action with cross-temporal benefits that improves decision accuracy (not ego/novelty). (Tags: decision theory; rarity; survival calculus; model correction; constraints; reconsolidation; cross-temporal benefit)
- 2026-01-05 — [Core Operator — Confidence-Weighting of Contextual Details](./2026-01-05--core-operator-confidence-weighting-of-contextual-details.md) — Controllable lever in reconsolidation: reassign confidence-weights (predictive authority) to contextual details; events stay fixed while weights determine impact. (Tags: reconsolidation; belief updating; memory; identity updating; predictive authority; priors; confidence weighting)
- 2026-01-04 — [Event Embedding — Post-Interaction Harm Framing Pattern](./2026-01-04--event-embedding-post-interaction-harm-framing-pattern.md) — Recurrent father–son pattern where, at conversation termination (especially when outcomes diverge from his intended frame), the ending is retroactively reframed as harm/neglect attributable to me, creating pressure for undefined repair and displacing emotional responsibility. (Tags: post-interaction harm framing; retroactive emotional blame; termination reframing; responsibility displacement; guilt induction; attachment threat response; authority preservation via moral framing)
