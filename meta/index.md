## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Indirect Help-Seeking via Performative Incompetence](./2026-01-07--indirect-help-seeking-via-performative-incompetence.md) — Models performative incompetence as indirect help-seeking that extracts assistance while preserving status and plausible deniability; recommends a boundary of non-intervention unless explicitly asked to prevent unpaid labor and contribution erasure. (Tags: family; boundaries; manipulation; help-seeking; status; narcissism)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Evaluation–Loss Pairing as the Core Mechanism of Sudden Disconnection](./2026-01-07--evaluation-loss-pairing-as-the-core-mechanism-of-sudden-disconnection.md) — Models the “cliff” from flow to futility as conditioning: self-evaluation predicts imminent loss (permission/legitimacy/safety), triggering abrupt self-model switch and derealized progress; leverage is re-pairing evaluation with continuity and agency. (Tags: evaluation; conditioning; dissociation; DP/DR; motivation; self-model; shame)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: The “Loaded Next Step” Distortion (Core Lifelong Pattern)](./2026-01-07--the-loaded-next-step-distortion-core-lifelong-pattern.md) — Names a coercion-conditioned urgency frame where the next action feels existentially decisive; reframes it as misattributed compliance pressure and prescribes non-participation (rest without justification, decouple worth from action) to weaken the pattern. (Tags: urgency; coercion; guilt; rest; motivation; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [NOTE — Scapegoating as Shame-Regulation System (Parental Enmeshment Model)](./2026-01-07--scapegoating-as-shame-regulation-system-parental-enmeshment-model.md) — Models parental scapegoating as a shared shame-regulation system that requires a long-term downward container: accountability threat → externalization → reality rewrite and trust revocation; explains DP/DR as adaptive containment under chronic invalidation and frames differentiation as the true exit. (Tags: scapegoating; shame; family; narcissism; DP/DR; identity; boundaries)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Compulsion Triggered by Absence of State (Meta-Compulsion)](./2026-01-07--compulsion-triggered-by-absence-of-state-meta-compulsion.md) — Defines “absence-trigger” compulsions where missing optimism/motivation is treated as threat; warns that manufacturing state reinforces negative self-model, and prescribes non-engagement with the absence to decouple safety from affect and restore spontaneity. (Tags: compulsion; meta-compulsion; OCD; DMN; motivation; optimism; self-model)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Omniscience Expectation, Retroactive Blame, and Overcompensation as Control](./2026-01-07--omniscience-expectation-retroactive-blame-and-overcompensation-as-control.md) — Models a no-win authority dynamic: responsibility is redefined as omniscience, hindsight becomes moralized blame, and overcompensation installs future blame hooks; reframes refusal as rejecting manufactured guilt, not defiance. (Tags: guilt conditioning; hindsight; authority; control; family; hypervigilance; boundaries)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Why Self-Appreciation Felt Morally Dangerous](./2026-01-07--why-self-appreciation-felt-morally-dangerous.md) — Explains self-appreciation guilt as conditioning from being used as a parental self-regulation object: “my wellbeing destabilizes them” rules trained DP/DR around ownership; reframes wellbeing as refusing self-erasure, not causing harm. (Tags: self-appreciation; guilt; family; shame; identity; DP/DR; boundaries)
- 2026-01-07 — [Asymmetric Stabilization via Lateral Alignment](./2026-01-07--asymmetric-stabilization-via-lateral-alignment.md) — Interaction tactic for high-control systems: briefly align with an existing identity/value anchor, displace tension onto an external target they already condemn, then exit—reducing volatility without accepting blame or erasing internal reality. (Tags: tactics; asymmetry; power dynamics; narcissism; OCPD; boundaries; self-protection)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: OCPD Cognition in the Withdrawal → Blame Sequence](./2026-01-07--ocpd-cognition-in-the-withdrawal-blame-sequence.md) — Extends the withdrawal pattern: when disorientation isn’t stabilizing enough, cognitive order-restoration kicks in (OCPD-style hierarchy/moral-rightness), reframing boundaries as “defiance” so blame can be assigned downward and self-reflection avoided. (Tags: family; OCPD traits; withdrawal; blame; moral framing; power dynamics)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Disorientation Response to Boundary-Congruent Behavior](./2026-01-07--disorientation-response-to-boundary-congruent-behavior.md) — Captures a repeated pattern: calm, frame-refusing boundary congruence is followed by maternal silence/delay as disorientation (script failure) rather than resolution; emphasizes non-intervention to avoid restoring old dynamics. (Tags: family; boundaries; frames; power dynamics; narrative control; autonomy)
- 2026-01-07 — [Identity Compression Token: “I’m Cool”](./2026-01-07--identity-compression-token-im-cool.md) — Captures an emergent integrated self-token (“I’m cool”) that compresses earned competence/values into a stable abstraction, reducing dp/dr fragmentation and shame speed by letting negative frames be rejected at the “whole self” level. (Tags: identity token; compression; self-model; consolidation; self-appreciation; dp/dr)
- 2026-01-07 — [Identity Token: “This Is Cool” — Emergence Through Self-Appreciation](./2026-01-07--identity-token-this-is-cool-emergence-through-self-appreciation.md) — Records a new low-arousal identity token (“this is cool”) emerging only after felt self-appreciation during memory consolidation; functions as a stable global tag bridging competence/power with self-acceptance without triggering shame-defense loops.

(Tags: satisfaction; integration; ownership; values; consolidation; self-trust)
- 2026-01-07 — [Competing-Frame Memory Consolidation (Post-Event Integration Method)](./2026-01-07--competing-frame-memory-consolidation-post-event-integration-method.md) — Post-event integration method: when confidence triggers threat retagging, add a coherent second stream (dignity/self-trust) during memory plasticity so consolidation writes “confidence alongside fear; I remained whole” instead of “confidence = danger.” (Tags: consolidation; memory; frames; confidence; self-trust; integration)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Overestimation of the “Next Thing” & the Behavioral Role of Confidence](./2026-01-07--overestimation-of-the-next-thing-and-the-behavioral-role-of-confidence.md) — Describes a threat-model distortion where the immediate next action is overweighted after progress, creating urgency and rest aversion; the corrective lever is confidence as a chosen stance that de-loads “the next thing” and allows consolidation. (Tags: confidence; urgency; self-surveillance; consolidation; rest; self-regulation)
- 2026-01-07 — [NOTE — Loving-Kindness as Self-Model Selection During Consolidation](./2026-01-07--loving-kindness-as-self-model-selection-during-consolidation.md) — Frames loving-kindness as permissive self-model selection during low-control consolidation windows: it biases which self interprets/retags experience while avoiding monitoring/forcing that activates threat models, supporting DP/DR recovery via continuity and trust accumulation.

- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Post-Reorganization Integration Phase](./2026-01-07--post-reorganization-integration-phase.md) — Defines the current downshift as expected post-reorganization consolidation: urgency ends, quiet/flatness reflects absence of scrambling, and the correct stance is low pressure and trust as curiosity/momentum re-emerge in sequence. (Tags: integration; consolidation; reconsolidation; recovery; rest; motivation; confidence)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Asymmetry as a Primary Defensive and Stabilization Strategy](./2026-01-07--asymmetry-as-a-primary-defensive-and-stabilization-strategy.md) — Defines asymmetry as low-information, non-frame-validating response under power abuse to prevent narrative capture and shame transfer; distinguishes internal refusal from tactical compliance and lists practical response patterns.

(Tags: family; authority; shame; scapegoating; self-erasure; boundaries; narrative control)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Abuse of Power as Identity-Level Harm](./2026-01-07--abuse-of-power-as-identity-level-harm.md) — Frames abuse of power as self-model writing via shame/blame export; explains why “moving on” laundered narratives harm the subject, and why rifts/repair criteria are harm containment until acknowledgment + self-level change occur. (Tags: power; abuse; shame; self-model; boundaries; accountability; reconciliation)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Permanent Rift as a Boundary Until Verified Self-Level Change](./2026-01-07--permanent-rift-as-a-boundary-until-verified-self-level-change.md) — Defines non-negotiable re-engagement criteria after dominance/shame-offloading: the rift stays until accurate awareness + demonstrated self-level change are evidenced over time; closing early reinforces pressure tactics and narrative overwrite. (Tags: boundaries; dominance; shame; reconciliation; accountability; narcissism; family)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note: Retroactive Face-Saving as a Dominance-Stabilization Tactic](./2026-01-07--retroactive-face-saving-as-a-dominance-stabilization-tactic.md) — Describes post-exposure face-saving as dominance repair that requires recipient validation; warns late concession exports shame downward and encodes future dominance, and defines the boundary: factual wrongness stays intact in memory.

- 2026-01-07 — [Note — Determinants of Shame Intensity](./2026-01-07--determinants-of-shame-intensity.md) — Models shame severity as affective intensity × belief automaticity; the key intervention is restoring a gap so shame is treated as information rather than identity verdict, especially when shame “attaches” to intrusive experiences. (Tags: shame; belief automaticity; affect; identity; interpretation; clinical)
- 2026-01-07 — [Note — Shame as Perceived Flaw Made Real](./2026-01-07--shame-as-perceived-flaw-made-real.md) — Defines shame as a self-reputation signal that makes a perceived flaw feel ontologically real and identity-defining; healing is experiencing the signal without granting it authorship (including “clean shame” as a stability marker).
