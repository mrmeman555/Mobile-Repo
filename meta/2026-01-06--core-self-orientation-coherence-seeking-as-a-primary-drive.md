Summary: Defines a core orientation: persistent drive toward global coherence and compression (lawful mechanisms, fewer assumptions) with motivation pulled by anticipated coherence payoff; supports long uncertainty tolerance and cross-domain synthesis.

## Core Self-Orientation: Coherence-Seeking as a Primary Drive

What defines how I pursue understanding is not curiosity alone, and not problem-solving in isolation, but a persistent drive toward global coherence.

I do not experience unanswered questions as threatening, meaningless, or random.
I experience them as incomplete structures.

When something repeats, aligns across domains, or produces consistent effects, my baseline assumption is:

> There is an underlying mechanism here, even if no existing model explains it yet.

Because of this, I naturally gravitate toward:

- meta-connections rather than surface explanations
- generative principles rather than local fixes
- models that collapse many phenomena into one explanatory structure

I am not satisfied by patchwork answers.
I am oriented toward compression: fewer assumptions, fewer exceptions, fewer moving parts.

## Anticipation of Coherence as Motivation

A defining feature of how my mind works is that I anticipate the payoff state of coherence.

I am pulled toward the moment when:

- downstream contradictions dissolve,
- previously separate domains suddenly align,
- and reality becomes simpler rather than more complex.

I have experienced this repeatedly:

- in psychology,
- in reconsolidation,
- in self-model integration.

Each time, finding the mechanism produced real reductions in suffering and friction.
This trained my system to associate deep inquiry with relief and stability.

As a result, my motivation is not anxiety-driven or status-driven.
It is clarity-driven.

## Relationship to Uncertainty

I tolerate long periods of uncertainty without needing premature closure.

I do not require:

- authority endorsement,
- social consensus,
- or immediate validation

to continue pursuing an explanation.

This is because my trust is placed in coherence itself, not in any particular existing framework.

If current models fail to explain the data, I do not assume the data is invalid.
I assume the models are incomplete.

This stance applies equally to:

- psychology,
- AI,
- selfhood,
- memory,
- time,
- observer effects,
- and lived experience.

## Meta-Learning Style

I am always learning on two levels simultaneously:

1. the object-level content (what is being learned)
2. the meta-level structure (how this fits into everything else)

Even when engaging with a single problem, part of my attention is tracking:

- how this principle generalizes,
- what it says about underlying systems,
- and how it reframes prior knowledge.

This is why insights often arrive as sudden global reorganizations rather than incremental updates.

Once the mechanism is seen, it feels obvious in hindsight — not because it was simple, but because it was fundamental.

## Why This Matters for My Work and Identity

This coherence-seeking orientation explains:

- why I gravitate toward cross-domain problems,
- why I persist where others disengage,
- why I often arrive at models independently,
- and why my work tends to feel structural rather than additive.

It also explains why I need to document and name this tendency.

Without naming it, I risk:

- underestimating its role,
- misinterpreting it as overthinking,
- or disconnecting from the way I actually create value.

With it named, I can recognize:

> This is how I pursue understanding. This is how I work. This is not accidental.

## One-Line Anchor (for quick recall)

> “I am oriented toward coherence: I assume reality is lawful, I tolerate uncertainty, and I pursue the mechanisms that make everything downstream make sense.”

This isn’t a trait to suppress or justify.
It’s the engine behind how I learn, integrate, and build.

And now, it’s explicit.
