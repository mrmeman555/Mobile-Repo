# Compassionate and Selfish Power Pursuit

Summary: Clarifies that “selfish” power pursuit can mean self-anchored agency (restoring coherence/causal influence), not exploitation; argues compassion does not require self-sacrifice and is the constraint that keeps power usable, making explicit self-interest + compassionate governance a safer configuration than denied/unacknowledged power.

## 1) “Selfish” needs to be defined correctly

What is being described is not selfishness as:

- exploiting others
- externalizing cost
- stabilizing identity through domination
- prioritizing comfort over harm

What is being described is self-directed agency.

A more accurate term:

> Self-anchored power acquisition

Meaning:

- power pursued to stabilize coherence
- power pursued to end suffering
- power pursued because life matters

This is compatible with compassion—and can be a prerequisite for non-hypocritical compassion.

## 2) Why pursuing power to reduce your own suffering is valid

Mechanistically:

- DP/DR is a disorder of agency collapse
- chronic dissociation is maintained by learned powerlessness
- shame persists when the self cannot effectively alter environment or narrative

So the system needs:

> Restoration of causal influence

Power = ability to matter in the system.

Pursuing power to feel:

- real
- effective
- capable
- coherent

is repairing the action→outcome feedback loop, not indulging ego.

## 3) Why compassion does not require self-sacrifice

A common moral error:

> Compassion = self-denial

Functionally, compassion is:

> Accurate suffering recognition + refusal to add unnecessary harm

There is no exception clause for the self.

Compassion that excludes the self becomes unstable (resentment, collapse, covert dominance).

Honest self-interest + explicit constraint avoids that instability.


---

## 4) Why self-interested power pursuit often reduces suffering anyway

Compassion can emerge as a by-product of accurate self-interest:

- understanding causality
- reducing unnecessary pain
- preventing repetition (self and others)

Stable ethics can arise from self-preservation under constraint, not from self-denial.


---

## 5) Why named self-interest is safer than denied power

Denied power becomes distorted power.

When people are taught:

- “you shouldn’t want influence”
- “power is suspect”
- “self-interest is immoral”

they often pursue power unconsciously (poorly justified, responsibility externalized, harm projected).

The safer configuration is:

- naming the desire
- owning it explicitly
- binding it to awareness
- constraining it with compassion


---

## 6) Why this path reduces DP/DR specifically

DP/DR improves when:

- agency is restored
- identity feels causally effective
- the self no longer has to disappear to stay safe

Self-anchored power pursuit supports all three.


---

## 7) Clean formulation

> You pursue power because you want to live.  
> You accept compassion because harm destabilizes systems.  
> You reduce suffering because it aligns with durable self-interest.  
> You are honest about all three.

This is adult agency (mechanistic, not moral performance).


---

## 8) Final clarity

Self-interested power pursuit becomes dangerous when:

- shame is denied
- responsibility is avoided
- impact is ignored
- narrative replaces mechanism

Compassion keeps power usable without destroying the self that wields it.
