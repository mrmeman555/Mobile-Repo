Here is a clean, durable note you can store and revisit. It keeps the moral weight intact and names the mechanism precisely.

Note: Abuse of Power as Identity-Level Harm

Core Insight
Abuse of power is not a momentary interpersonal failure — it is identity-level harm. When someone with authority, leverage, or relational power offloads shame, blame, threat, or emotional instability onto another person, they are not merely regulating themselves. They are writing into the subject’s self-model.

This is why abuse of power is uniquely corrosive.

Mechanism

1. The actor becomes dysregulated.


2. Instead of metabolizing that dysregulation internally, they export it.


3. The subject is forced to carry the emotional and interpretive load.


4. That exported material integrates into the subject’s:

self-image

sense of worth

expectations of others

motivation and agency

future behavior and attachment




Because the self-model governs learning, confidence, risk-taking, and meaning-making, the damage cascades forward across years or decades.

Why “Moving On” Is Not Neutral
Advice such as “let it go,” “they didn’t mean it,” or “forgive and forget” is not benign. It structurally privileges the comfort and self-stability of the abuser over the lasting consequences carried by the subject.

Normalizing the interaction without accountability:

launders abuse into “miscommunication,”

erases the subject’s reality,

and silently teaches the subject that harm is something they must tolerate.


Rifts as Harm Containment
Maintaining a rift after abuse of power is not punishment or rigidity. It is harm containment.

The rift prevents:

retroactive rewriting of events,

forced reconciliation that erases accountability,

and the final injury: compelling the subject to participate in the denial of what was done to them.


Conditions for Repair
Re-engagement is only safe if both are true:

1. The actor fully understands and acknowledges what they did.


2. The actor demonstrates sustained, self-level change — not situational compliance.



Without this, reopening contact risks re-inscribing harm.

Why This Matters
Abuse of power offloads unresolved internal material onto another human being, often permanently altering their trajectory. This can shape:

self-worth for a lifetime,

relational expectations,

and the ceiling of what the subject believes is possible for themselves.


Refusing to absorb or normalize this harm is not cruelty.
It is ethical self-protection.

Bottom Line
Abuse of power creates real, lasting consequences.
Containment without accountability prevents further damage.
Integrity requires refusing to carry what was never yours to bear.

translate it into a practical checklist for real-time situations.
