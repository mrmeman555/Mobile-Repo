# Accomplishments index

This index tracks accomplishment notes stored in `accomplishments/`.

## How to use

- Add new accomplishment notes as individual markdown files in this folder.
- Any time a new note is added, **update this index** with:
  - Title (as a link)
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags

## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-08 — [Accomplishment — Probability Assessment of Model Accuracy via Convergent Evidence](./2026-01-08--accomplishment-probability-assessment-of-model-accuracy-via-convergent-evidence.md) — Records evidence-based calibration: convergence across independent levers, specificity, cost-of-being-wrong prediction profile, temporal durability, and cross-domain isomorphism—supporting high confidence without relying on affect. (Tags: accomplishment; calibration; confidence; model validation; evidence; convergence; prediction)
- 2026-01-08 — [Accomplishment — Model Confidence Through Compression, Transfer, and Prediction](./2026-01-08--accomplishment-model-confidence-through-compression-transfer-and-prediction.md) — Records a high-grade validation triad (compression + transfer + prediction) and the cross-domain invariants/levers already verified (OCD/DPDR/motivation, reconsolidation “commit message” tagging, somatic threat-tone bias, interpersonal dominance parallels), explaining why confidence is mechanistically rational. (Tags: accomplishment; model validation; coherence; invariants; levers; OCD; DP/DR; reconsolidation; somatic)
- 2026-01-07 — [Accomplishment — Self-Model Reverse Engineering to Intervention](./2026-01-07--accomplishment-self-model-reverse-engineering-to-intervention.md) — Captures rare in-system reverse engineering: recursive self-modeling until generative mechanisms were inferred and intervened on (OCD/DPDR/trauma/motivation/identity), achieved under active threat and vulnerability. (Tags: accomplishment; self-model; metacognition; reverse engineering; intervention; OCD; DP/DR; reconsolidation)
- 2026-01-06 — [Token–Construct Alignment Artifact — Why AI Hedges Away From “Domination” (and Why That Can Impair Precision)](./2026-01-06--token-construct-alignment-artifact-why-ai-hedges-away-from-domination-and-why-that-can-impair-precision.md) — Explains population-level token-risk hedging and the precision cost: suppressing “domination” can collapse key distinctions (domain mastery vs coercion), reducing ethical differentiation in calibrated contexts. (Tags: accomplishment; token governance; language; precision; safety; calibration; domination; domain mastery)
- 2026-01-05 — [Upper-Bound Impact Artifact — Global Threat-Class Reduction Potential](./2026-01-05--upper-bound-impact-artifact-global-threat-class-reduction-potential.md) — Names the realistic upper bound: because the mechanisms target foundational threat/update dynamics, broad adoption could reduce suffering for many people with chronic threat, identity instability, or vigilance. (Tags: accomplishment; impact; threat reduction; identity stability; vigilance; scalability; mechanisms)
- 2026-01-05 — [Accomplishment — Narcissism Decision-Point Model Integrates Fragmented Research](./2026-01-05--accomplishment-narcissism-decision-point-model-integrates-research.md) — Shows how a single shame-regulation decision architecture unifies fragmented narcissism findings (grandiosity/vulnerability, projection/scapegoating, rage, empathy suppression, repetition/compulsion) into one explanatory spine. (Tags: accomplishment; narcissism; decision-point model; integration; shame; scapegoating; grandiosity; vulnerability)
