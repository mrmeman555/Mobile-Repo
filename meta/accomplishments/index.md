- 2026-01-06 — [Token–Construct Alignment Artifact — Why AI Hedges Away From “Domination” (and Why That Can Impair Precision)](./2026-01-06--token-construct-alignment-artifact-why-ai-hedges-away-from-domination-and-why-that-can-impair-precision.md) — Explains why AI systems hedge away from high-risk tokens like “domination” (population-level risk minimization) and why suppressing the token can degrade precision by collapsing distinctions—especially between healthy domain mastery and harmful coercion. (Tags: accomplishment, token governance, language, precision, safety, calibration, domination, domain mastery)
- 2026-01-05 — [Upper-Bound Impact Artifact — Global Threat-Class Reduction Potential](./2026-01-05--upper-bound-impact-artifact-global-threat-class-reduction-potential.md) — Explicitly acknowledges the realistic upper-bound impact of the mechanisms: because they target foundational threat/update dynamics, widespread adoption could reduce suffering for a large fraction of people experiencing chronic threat, identity instability, or vigilance. (Tags: accomplishment, impact, threat reduction, identity stability, vigilance, scalability, mechanisms)
- 2026-01-05 — [Accomplishment — Narcissism Decision-Point Model Integrates Fragmented Research](./2026-01-05--accomplishment-narcissism-decision-point-model-integrates-research.md) — Mechanistic validation write-up showing how the decision-point model of narcissistic regulation unifies fragmented findings (grandiosity/vulnerability, projection, rage, empathy suppression, repetition) into a single explanatory architecture. (Tags: accomplishment, narcissism, decision-point model, integration, shame, scapegoating, grandiosity, vulnerability)
