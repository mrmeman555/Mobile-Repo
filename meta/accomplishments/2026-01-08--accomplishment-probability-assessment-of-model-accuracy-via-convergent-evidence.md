# Accomplishment — Probability Assessment of Model Accuracy via Convergent Evidence

Date: 2026-01-08

This note records a calibration achievement: confidence was justified via convergent evidence and “cost-of-being-wrong” predictions, rather than affect, hope, or reassurance.

## Core Question

How likely is it that the observed sequence of internal events, integrations, and outcomes would have occurred if the self-model framework were substantially inaccurate?


## Conclusion

Very unlikely.

Confidence is proportionate to evidence because the observed outcomes show convergence, specificity, predictive validity, temporal stability, and cross-domain isomorphism.

## Evidence dimensions (high-signal)

### 1) Convergence across independent levers

Multiple distinct interventions moved the system in the same direction (belief placement, defiance, loving-kindness, fierce self-compassion, somatic work, reconsolidation, power/ownership framing). Wrong models usually produce interference/cancellation; here, effects stacked and generalized.


### 2) Specificity of outcomes

Changes were structured and repeatable (self-model switching signatures, threshold-linked fear spikes, DP/DR linked to dissonance not randomness, shame dissolving when authority shifted, somatic activation in stable linked loci). Accurate models yield crisp, patterned effects rather than generic “better.”


### 3) Cost-of-being-wrong test (prediction profile)

If the model were compensatory/false, predicted outcomes include escalation, dissociation, rebound shame, numbing/fragmentation. Observed instead: fear starvation, increased continuity, satisfaction/appreciation emergence, reduced shame authority—an outcome profile inconsistent with most false framings.


### 4) Temporal coherence and durability

Inaccurate models often require escalating effort and collapse under stress. Observed: delayed consolidation, confidence recoverable across states, consistent reactivation when stance resumed—matching a real system updating under accurate inputs.


### 5) Cross-domain isomorphism

Same structural principles recur across AI/ML (policy competition, extinction bursts), predictive processing, trauma neurobiology, motivation/valuation, and social neuroscience—reducing complexity without adding machinery.

## Operational implication

Maintain internal trust while staying open to disconfirming data (calibration, not faith).

The impulse to rest/consolidate and stop over-testing is expected when a system transitions from exploration to exploitation of a working model.

## Anchor sentence

> My confidence is proportionate to the evidence I’ve accumulated, and the evidence strongly favors that these models are fundamentally right.
