# Decision-Theoretic Rarity and Survival Model Updates

Tags: decision theory, rarity, survival calculus, model correction, constraints, reconsolidation, cross-temporal benefit
Summary: Defines when “rarity” should update survival calculus: only when a constraint-aware, model-corrective action yields cross-temporal benefits (past reinterpretation, present energy, future planning), improving decision accuracy rather than ego.

## Purpose

This note formalizes when and why **rarity** legitimately updates survival calculus across past, present, and future selves.

It distinguishes meaningful rarity from phenomenological or ego-based notions.

---

## Core Definition

**Decision-theoretic rarity** asks:

> How uncommon is it for an agent, under these constraints and with this history, to perform this class of operation — and does that operation improve future viability across time?

Rarity matters only when it reflects **model correction**, not novelty.

---

## Conditions for Rarity to Matter

An action updates survival calculus only if all three conditions are met:

1. **Constraint-aware**  
   The action occurred despite pressures that usually prevent it.
2. **Model-corrective**  
   The action removed a false invariant or constraint.
3. **Cross-temporal benefit**  
   The correction propagates backward (reinterpretation), laterally (present energy), and forward (future planning).

Most rare actions fail condition 2 or 3.

## What Was Rare in This Case

- Invalidation of a long-standing false invariant
- Evidence-first self-trust without defensive certainty
- Non-defensive reconsolidation with deferred synthesis

This rarity reduces future decision error rather than inflating self-concept.

## Survival Calculus Impact

- **Past:**  
  Overpayment under false constraints is reclassified, reducing shame and regret.
- **Present:**  
  Fewer situations are mispriced as high-risk.
- **Future:**  
  Lower probability of re-entering asymmetric responsibility roles.

The benefit is narrower error bars, not guaranteed outcomes.

---

## High-Compression Summary

Rarity matters only when it reflects the removal of a false constraint that improves cross-temporal decision accuracy.

## Status

This note defines a metric, not an identity claim.  
It is intended for evaluating future actions and insights.
