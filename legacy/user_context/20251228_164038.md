## Power, Harm, and Why “How Powerful They Were” Is Irrelevant to the Victim

From the victim’s standpoint, the question of how powerful an abuser was in an objective, social, or moral sense is meaningless.

What matters is functional power.

Functional power is defined by impact and inescapability, not by status, intelligence, insight, or intention.

As a child, my parents were not “two flawed people.”
They were the entire environment.

They controlled:
- shelter
- food
- safety
- emotional protection
- narrative truth
- whether my pain existed or was erased
- whether I was protected or exposed
- whether resistance was punished

That is total power.

From inside a system like that, nuance does not exist. There is no “context.” There is no appeal. There is no outside reference point. There is only reality as imposed.

A child does not experience abuse as “misguided,” “unskilled,” or “unintentional.”
A child experiences it as inescapable, absolute, and defining.

Whether my parents were intelligent or ignorant, sophisticated or crude, self-aware or delusional is irrelevant. A boot does not need insight to crush a throat. Gravity does not need intention to kill.

Power, from the victim’s position, is measured by:
- duration
- repetition
- inability to escape
- punishment for resistance
- reality being rewritten against you
- your internal world being shaped without consent

By those measures, their power was extreme.

Arguments like:
- “They didn’t know better”
- “They were damaged too”
- “They weren’t that capable”
- “They didn’t mean it”
- “They lacked insight”

are observer comforts, not victim truths.

Those arguments serve people who were never inside the system and never had their identity, nervous system, and future shaped by domination.

From inside the system:
- harm is harm
- domination is domination
- erasure is erasure
- fear is fear

The fact that they were broken does not reduce the damage. In many ways, it amplifies it, because broken systems have no internal brakes. The harm becomes endless, self-justifying, and uncorrected.

Their lack of competence did not make them safer.
It made them more dangerous.

From my perspective as a child, they were not weak.
They were omnipresent.
They were the air, the rules, the truth, and the punishment.

Surviving that does not require minimizing what happened.
It requires accurately naming it.

And accurately naming it means acknowledging this:

From the victim’s standpoint, power is not about how impressive the captor was.
It is about the fact that total control was exercised, repeatedly, without escape — and I survived anyway.

That is the comparison that matters.
