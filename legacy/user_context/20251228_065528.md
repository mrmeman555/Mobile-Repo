## Note: Existential Threat, Installed Fear, and Why Man’s Search for Meaning Resonates

What I am recognizing now is that my childhood did not merely involve stress, strictness, or emotional hardship. It involved sustained existential threat, delivered during the most developmentally vulnerable period of my life, by authority figures whose claims were absolute and non-falsifiable.

I was told, explicitly and implicitly, that I might be going to hell.
Not as a metaphor.
Not as a distant theological abstraction.
But as a real, imminent possibility.

I was taught that the terror in my chest was God communicating with me — that the fear itself was evidence of my moral failure. When I asked how to make it stop, I was not given reassurance or grounding. I was told to pray for forgiveness. The implication was clear: relief was conditional, and safety was never guaranteed.

This is not ordinary fear.
This is existential terror.

A child cannot reality-check eternity. A child cannot disprove hell. A child cannot step outside the authority of adults who claim to speak for God. There is no appeal process. No external verification. No way to “grow out of it” while still dependent.

The result is predictable and devastating: the nervous system stays activated indefinitely.

The feeling in my chest never left — not because something was wrong with me, but because the threat was never resolved. I carried this fear into adolescence, into adulthood. I was not fully convinced I wasn’t going to hell until my twenties. That means this was not a passing belief; it was a developmental environment.

This reframes everything.

When I listen to *Man’s Search for Meaning* and my mind tries to say, “My situation wasn’t that bad,” I can now see that this is conditioning — not truth. Frankl is not writing only about concentration camps. He is writing about what happens when meaning itself is weaponized, when survival requires internal reconstruction under conditions of total power asymmetry.

The parallels are structural:
- Absolute authority controlling reality and meaning
- Threat framed as infinite and irreversible
- No external validation or escape
- Identity tied to compliance
- Fear enforced as moral necessity

What breaks people is not pain alone. It is inescapable meaning imposed by force.

That is what I lived with.

The reason this material resonates so deeply now is because my body recognizes it. My nervous system understands what it means to live under an omnipresent, unanswerable threat. The fact that this threat was metaphysical rather than physical does not make it less severe — in many ways, it makes it worse, because it cannot be outrun, negotiated with, or disproven.

This context matters because it explains why my later healing required such depth, such persistence, and such self-directed effort. I was not recovering from anxiety. I was dismantling an internally installed system of terror that had been justified as truth.

The most important realization is this:
Nothing about my reaction was a personal failure.
Nothing about my fear was weakness.
Nothing about my vigilance meant I was broken.

My nervous system did exactly what it was designed to do under existential threat.

And the fact that I am here now — reflective, grounded, capable of authorship over my own meaning — is not accidental. It is the result of enduring an environment that would have erased most people, and then rebuilding from the inside without external rescue.

Survival itself was meaning.
Reclaiming authorship is the next step.

This is not exaggeration.
This is an accurate accounting of what happened
