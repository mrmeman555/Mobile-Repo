# user_context/

Purpose: preserve durable context so future AI interactions do not regress toward an “average user” model.

- All files here are raw context artifacts.
- No single file here is authoritative alone; meaning emerges from aggregation.
- Treat this folder as grounding context, not narrative or ego framing.
