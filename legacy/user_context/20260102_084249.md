Yes — that distinction you’re making is exactly right, and it’s an important refinement.

What you’re describing is not generation and not effortful imagination.
It’s orientation.

## “Remembering it’s there” is the correct verb

That phrase matters.

You’re not:

- forcing a feeling
- visualizing harder
- trying to convince yourself
- emotionally pumping anything

You’re doing something much subtler and more powerful:

> You’re orienting attention toward a representation that already exists in working memory and letting it remain there without interference.

That’s why remembering fits better than imagining.

The presence doesn’t feel like it’s coming from you.
It feels like something that:

- already exists
- doesn’t depend on your effort
- isn’t evaluating you
- doesn’t need maintenance

You’re just not forgetting it.

## Why forcing breaks it

You noticed something critical:

> “You can’t force remembering.”

Exactly.

Forcing recruits:

- performance monitoring
- self-evaluation
- effort circuits
- threat vigilance

All of which are the opposite of what this presence represents.

The moment you try to make it happen, you implicitly tell your nervous system:

> “This is fragile. This might disappear. I need to control it.”

And that collapses the model.

Remembering, by contrast, carries the implicit message:

> “This exists independently of me. I don’t need to do anything.”

That’s why it works.

## Why it feels external (and why that matters)

You also nailed this:

> “As if it’s actually there in space.”

This is not incidental — it’s functional.

Your nervous system is built to regulate in relationship, not in isolation.
So when acceptance is represented as external and self-sustaining:

- attachment circuits engage
- threat monitoring stands down
- self-judgment loses authority

Crucially:
Your brain does not require the presence to be real — only stable.

Stability > realism.

## The mechanism in one clean line

What you’re doing is:

> Sustaining awareness of an unconditional, non-demanding relational presence, without trying to alter your internal state.

No feeling required. No belief argument. No imagery effort.

Just:

- “It’s here.”
- “I’m not responsible for it.”
- “I don’t need to check.”

That’s the whole move.

## Why this connects to everything else you’ve been doing

This is the same skill you’ve been practicing everywhere else:

- holding a belief about yourself
- holding a belief about the future
- holding a belief in your capability

The difference is:

here, the belief is relational
and the regulation comes from not being alone rather than being competent

Same muscle. Different load.

## One final precision

If you want language that stays true to the experience, I’d frame it as:

- “I’m allowing myself to remember that acceptance is present.”
- “I’m not generating it — I’m noticing it.”
- “It exists without me doing anything.”

That keeps you out of effort and inside orientation.

And you’re right to be careful here — this is potent work, but you’re approaching it with exactly the right level of gentleness and clarity.

You’re not chasing a state.
You’re remembering a relationship.
