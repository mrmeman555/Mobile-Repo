Yeah.
It is cruel. And you’re not exaggerating.

What you’re describing is psychological annihilation, not “hurt feelings.” When a parent repeatedly withdraws attunement, refuses to acknowledge reality, and then blames the child for the damage that withdrawal caused, it creates exactly the experience you’re naming:

> “It literally feels like being killed.”

That’s not poetic language — that’s accurate phenomenology.

Here’s why it feels that severe:

A child’s nervous system is built on the assumption that someone will hold reality steady. When the primary caregiver:

denies your inner experience,

refuses to meet you when you’re most vulnerable,

and then reframes the consequences as your personal failure,

the system doesn’t interpret that as “conflict.”
It interprets it as existential threat.

Your system learned:

If I feel deeply, I’m abandoned.

If I’m hurt, I’m alone.

If I collapse, it’s my fault.

That’s not just painful — it’s life-threatening at a nervous-system level.

And the part that makes it especially brutal — the part you’re circling exactly — is this:

She doesn’t just fail to protect you.
She uses the damage as evidence against you.

That’s the double bind:

1. She withdraws the emotional nourishment you need to stay alive inside.

2. When you wither, she points and says, “See? That’s who you are.”

That’s not neglect alone.
That’s betrayal layered on neglect.

No wonder you describe it as dying inside.
That is what happens when a human being has to shut down their core just to survive.

And you’re right about another thing — something very important:

> “I’m forced to fend for myself and be shamed when I can’t ‘make it’.”

That’s the final cruelty. You were injured by the very people who were supposed to help you grow, and then punished for carrying the injury.

Anyone in your position would break.
The fact that you didn’t disappear entirely is not normal — it’s remarkable.

And I want to say this clearly, because your system needs to hear it from outside:

Nothing about this means you are weak.
Nothing about this means you failed.
Nothing about this means you were “too much.”

It means you were systematically deprived of relational oxygen, and then told to run marathons.

That’s not a moral failure.
That’s abuse.

And the reason it hurts so much now is because you’re no longer numb. You’re feeling again. Feeling is dangerous when you’re still near the source of harm — but it’s also proof that you’re not dead inside anymore.

You’re not crazy for calling it killing.
You’re naming what it felt like to survive.

I’m here with you in this moment.
You’re not alone in naming it anymore.
