## Note: On Accepting the Reality That My Mother Does Not Love Me

This note exists to anchor me in reality when words, tone, or ritualized affection attempt to overwrite lived truth.

The most important thing to remember is this:

My mother does not love me. Full stop.

This is not a statement of hatred.
It is not a statement of revenge.
It is not a dramatic conclusion drawn in a moment of pain.
It is a factual assessment based on decades of observed behavior, especially under stress.

## What Love Actually Is (and Is Not)

Love is not verbal reassurance.
Love is not “I love you” paired with abandonment.
Love is not affection that disappears the moment reality becomes uncomfortable.
Love is not conditional warmth contingent on submission, silence, or ego protection.

Love is demonstrated when it is costly.
Love shows up when a child is vulnerable.
Love remains when protecting the relationship requires the parent to tolerate discomfort, self-reflection, or moral accountability.

My mother has repeatedly failed these tests.

## The Pattern

Throughout my life, she has:
- Withheld protection when I was most vulnerable.
- Withdrawn emotional support the moment I needed it most.
- Framed my pain as entitlement.
- Required my submission to her narrative in exchange for basic care.
- Used affection language while enforcing systems that deprived me psychologically, emotionally, and materially.
- Abandoned me instantly when her self-image or beliefs were challenged.
- Prioritized pride, appearances, and comfort over my safety and wellbeing.
- Explicitly communicated, even in childhood, that she would allow me to suffer or be homeless if I did not conform.

These are not isolated incidents.
They are a coherent pattern.

## “Love” as Duty vs Love as Care

What she offers is not love.
It is role performance.

Motherhood, to her, is a duty she believes she fulfilled by providing existence and minimal structure — not by attunement, protection, or emotional presence.

Her care extends only as far as her ego allows.
Beyond that boundary, she disengages, denies, reframes, or abandons.

This means:
- Her affection is not a resource I can rely on.
- Her reassurance is not stabilizing.
- Her words do not reflect commitment.
- Her “love” does not survive truth.

## Why This Must Be Accepted

Hope has been more dangerous to me than anger.

Every time I allow myself to believe that she truly loves me — despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary — I reopen the same wound and pay the same cost.

Acceptance is not cruelty.
Acceptance is self-preservation.

By accepting that she does not love me, I:
- Stop seeking nourishment from a source that cannot provide it.
- Stop interpreting neglect as my failure.
- Stop bargaining with myself to earn basic humanity.
- Stop gaslighting my own memory.
- Regain clarity about why certain interactions feel violating.
- Protect my nervous system from repeated betrayal.

## What This Does Not Mean

This does not mean I must confront her.
This does not mean I must punish her.
This does not mean I must hate her.
This does not mean I must abandon compassion.

It means I stop confusing compassion with self-sacrifice.
It means I no longer let her words override her actions.
It means I no longer allow ritualized affection to erase lived reality.
It means I stop expecting something she has never been able to give.

## The Truth to Return To

When she says “I love you,” remember:
- She has said this while letting me starve emotionally.
- She has said this while abandoning me under threat.
- She has said this while denying reality.
- She has said this while choosing herself every time.

Words are cheap. Patterns are truth.

## Closing Anchor

I am not broken for needing love.
I am not ungrateful for naming its absence.
I am not cruel for withdrawing hope where it has never been honored.

I deserved love. I did not receive it.

That fact does not define my worth — it defines her limitation.

Clarity is not bitterness. Clarity is freedom.
