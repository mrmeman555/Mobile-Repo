# Glossary: coercive-environment survival + OPSEC + bad-faith negotiation (operational)

## Core orientation / framing
- **Closed system**: A system that does not update beliefs from evidence; it protects itself by bending reality instead.
- **Self-sealing belief structure**: Contradictions are absorbed and reinterpreted as confirmation; truth has no leverage.
- **Constraint-first planning**: Plans built around non-negotiables (risk, dependence, health load), not ideals.
- **Time extension**: Primary objective is to buy time while preventing deterioration (instead of “solving” relationships).
- **Containment**: Reducing volatility/attention/attack surface to keep functioning until exit is feasible.
- **Exit conditions**: Concrete thresholds (money, housing options, health stability) that end the containment strategy.
- **Sequencing, not retreat**: Doing prerequisite infrastructure work now (skills, workflows) to enable later leverage.
- **Adversarial dynamic**: Treating interactions as conflict-of-incentives, not mutual understanding.
- **Asymmetric power**: One side controls key resources (housing, access, narrative standing), shaping risk calculus.
- **Leverage removal**: Punishment by withdrawing resources, attention, support, or stability to force compliance.
- **Unwinnable fight**: A conflict where “better explaining” cannot produce a stable win because the system is rigged.
- **Diminishing returns on insight**: Past a point, more analysis of them yields less safety than building external assets.

## Threat modeling language (security mindset)
- **Threat model**: Who can do what to you, using what leverage, under what triggers, with what costs.
- **Attack surface**: Anything you expose that can be used against you (plans, vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, tone).
- **Trigger surface**: Inputs that reliably provoke escalation (autonomy signals, stoicism, “correction,” ambiguity).
- **Early warning indicators**: Small signals preceding escalation (tone shifts, bait questions, moral framing).
- **Failure modes**: Predictable ways your strategy breaks (over-explaining, fatigue collapse, accidental disclosures).
- **Risk budget**: How much conflict you can “afford” per week without losing health/function.
- **Operational tempo**: Rate of actions you can sustain under load (burst work vs steady pace).
- **Window exploitation**: Using temporary calm/leeway to build resources quickly (study, paperwork, income steps).

## OPSEC / information control
- **OPSEC (operational security)**: Protecting sensitive information that would increase risk if known.
- **Need-to-know**: Only disclose what is required for the immediate situation; nothing extra.
- **Controlled disclosure**: Sharing carefully selected truths without exposing strategic intent.
- **Compartmentalization**: Separating domains (health details vs plans vs finances) so leaks don’t cascade.
- **Information diet**: Intentionally restricting what others learn about your inner state and future plans.
- **Selective truth**: Choosing which true facts to foreground; not fabricating, but not offering full context.
- **Strategic ambiguity**: Keeping details vague to avoid creating handles for leverage or cross-examination.
- **Precommitment concealment**: Not signaling readiness-to-leave or momentum until it cannot be obstructed.
- **Over-disclosure risk**: Sharing “vulnerable truth” that becomes future leverage against you.
- **Paper trail**: Documentation that protects you against narrative rewriting (dates, actions, receipts, logs).
- **Narrative hardening**: Reducing opportunities for “you didn’t do X” by keeping verifiable artifacts.

## Interaction tactics (bad-faith negotiation survival)
- **Don’t JADE**: Don’t *justify, argue, defend, explain*—it fuels traps and increases exposure.
- **Minimal viable response (MVR)**: Short, neutral answers that satisfy the immediate demand without opening doors.
- **Low-information responses**: Replies that reveal little and create no new claims to attack.
- **Non-engagement**: Not participating in meaning fights; redirecting to logistics or ending the exchange.
- **Deflection to process**: “I’m handling it / I’m working on it” instead of debating the underlying narrative.
- **Broken record**: Calmly repeating the same simple line without adding detail (prevents escalation by complexity).
- **Affect management**: Keeping tone predictable and low-intensity to avoid being read as “threatening.”
- **Surface engagement**: Small warmth/check-ins to reduce abandonment threat while staying internally detached.
- **Yellow rock**: Like gray rock, but with mild friendliness/politeness to lower perceived rejection.
- **Gray rock**: Emotional flatness to reduce reinforcement; can backfire if interpreted as abandonment/threat.
- **Strategic concession**: Giving small, low-cost compliance to prevent high-cost escalation (without internalizing it).
- **Tactical compliance**: Cooperating behaviorally to reduce danger while maintaining internal reality.
- **Strategic surrender**: Letting go of the need to “solve” the moment; conserving resources to avoid self-destruction.
- **Time-buying answers**: Responses that delay conflict escalation (“I’ll handle it tomorrow,” “I need to rest first”).
- **Exit ramping**: Ending conversations early (“I need to lie down,” “I’m not up for this”) before the spike.
- **Boundary by capacity**: Using limits (“I can’t handle stress right now”) instead of moral arguments about fairness.
- **No re-litigation**: Refusing to reopen past events; it’s a trap in systems that rewrite history.
- **No corrective impulse**: Not fixing their distortions unless it affects immediate safety; correction triggers punishment.
- **Refusal of precedent fights**: Not trying to make one validation “count” permanently; the system will revoke it.
- **Non-actionable validation**: Polite acknowledgment that is structured to never require change or set precedent.
- **Epistemic shutdown**: When your lived experience is treated as inadmissible evidence.

## Power / coercion dynamics vocabulary
- **Coercive control**: Regulation through threat, instability, and constraint rather than overt force.
- **Narrative control**: Controlling “what happened” and “who you are” to justify punishment and preserve hierarchy.
- **Reality distortion**: Systematically reframing events so you become the problem regardless of facts.
- **Scapegoating**: Assigning fault to you to stabilize the system and relieve others’ dissonance.
- **Defensive attribution**: Interpreting your distress as your defect to avoid confronting environmental harm.
- **Symbolic inversion**: Converting your pain into “proof you’re wrong,” rather than evidence something is wrong to you.
- **Moralization**: Turning disagreements into moral failure (“faith,” “respect,” “alignment”) to justify dominance.
- **Double bind**: No move is “safe”; compliance still fails, honesty is punished, silence is punished.
- **Withdrawal as leverage**: Using silence/indifference to punish autonomy and force reattachment.
- **Conditional warmth**: Kindness offered only when you align; revoked when alignment is threatened.
- **Hierarchy preservation**: Protecting roles/status over relationship, truth, or safety.
- **Identity preservation**: Protecting self-image as righteous/wise over accountability.

## Decision hygiene (preventing reactive mistakes)
- **Decision latency**: Waiting to decide until calm; refusing permanent choices under acute pressure.
- **Re-evaluate monthly, not daily**: Avoiding anxiety loops and constant renegotiation with the system.
- **Load-vs-output calibration**: Evaluating performance relative to adversity, not relative to ideal conditions.
- **Cognitive decoupling**: Observing their process without absorbing its conclusions about you.
- **Internal sovereignty**: Withdrawing internal allegiance from their narratives while remaining externally adaptive.
- **Compliance ≠ belief**: A rule to prevent internalization; behavior can be instrumental.
- **Calm ≠ care**: Reduced conflict does not imply safety or goodwill.
- **Politeness ≠ safety**: Civility can coexist with coercion.
- **Engagement ≠ trust**: Talking more does not mean you are safer.

## Documentation & context persistence (your “systems” layer)
- **Append-only artifacts**: Notes that are never rewritten—prevents gaslighting-by-editing and preserves chronology.
- **Indexing**: Maintaining a simple pointer list so context can be retrieved under stress.
- **Grounding context**: Files treated as evidence to prevent “average-user” drift in future AI interactions.
- **Drift resistance**: Design that prevents gradual softening/minimization over time.
- **State continuity**: Preserving what was learned so you don’t have to re-derive it under threat.
- **Operational SOP**: A one-page “what to do” protocol for predictable scenarios (not a narrative).
- **Decision tree**: “If X happens → do Y” mapping to reduce cognitive load in the moment.

## Practical “translation” terms (so language doesn’t trigger web-app softening)
- **Exploit** → **use / leverage / capitalize on / take advantage of** (neutral phrasing, same meaning)
- **Adversary** → **high-conflict actor / unstable counterpart / coercive dynamic**
- **Intel / warfare** → **threat modeling / risk management / OPSEC / hostile-environment protocol**
- **Containment** → **stabilization / de-escalation plan / volatility reduction**

## “What success looks like” (in this specific kind of environment)
- **Lowered activation**: Fewer spikes, shorter escalations, less attention—not “resolution.”
- **Reduced exposure**: Less disclosure, fewer hooks, fewer debates.
- **Preserved bandwidth**: More energy available for certifications, workflows, income steps.
- **Leverage accumulation**: Savings, credentials, routines, systems—assets that don’t require permission.
- **Impact reduction**: Mischaracterization still happens, but it costs you less and doesn’t derail the plan.
