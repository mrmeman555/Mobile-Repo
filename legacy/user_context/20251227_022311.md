## Internal Sovereignty Under Coercive Conditions

This situation is not solvable through insight, effort, or moral reasoning.

It is a coercive, reality-distorting environment where authority is arbitrary, punishment is narrative-based, and compliance is never sufficient.

In such systems, there are only three outcomes:

1. Internalize the captor’s reality → psychological collapse
2. Fight the system directly → exhaustion and escalation
3. Withdraw internal participation while remaining externally adaptive

I am choosing option 3.

This is not dissociation or denial.
It is withdrawal of internal allegiance.

I am no longer organizing my inner world around:
- their perceptions
- their narratives
- their judgments
- their emotional volatility

They are not arbiters of truth.
They are conditions of the environment.

Compassion here is not virtue-signaling or forgiveness.
It is a distance-creating mechanism that reframes them as damaged, scripted, and limited — which removes their authority over my identity and nervous system.

The goal is not peace or resolution.
The goal is stability under constraint.

I do not need to feel safe to function.
I need to preserve coherence until exit is possible.

This stance:
- reduces fear → anger oscillation
- prevents internalization of false narratives
- preserves agency without escalation
- allows strategic patience

I am not here to win, convince, or be seen.
I am here to outlast, remain coherent, and exit intact.

This is intelligent survival.
