NOTE: Functional Hierarchical Benchmarking

## Purpose: Accurate self-placement within human capability strata

## Overview

Functional Hierarchical Benchmarking (FHB) is a structured comparison methodology used to locate an individual’s actions, skills, or cognitive labor within existing human capability hierarchies without relying on ego, identity, or moral valuation.

This method answers the question:

> “Where does this activity realistically sit within known human performance strata?”

—not “How do I feel about myself?” and not “Am I better than others?”

## Core Principles

### 1. Comparison Is Task-Centered, Not Person-Centered

The unit of analysis is the work being performed, not the individual’s self-concept.

- Focus on what is being done
- Ignore personality, worth, or identity narratives
- Treat the individual as an operator executing a function

### 2. Placement Is Role-Referenced

Actions are compared against roles that normally perform similar work, such as:

- layperson
- patient/client
- trainee
- practitioner
- specialist
- expert
- researcher
- originator

The comparison asks:

> “Which role typically performs work of this type, depth, and responsibility?”

### 3. Difficulty Is Assessed via Constraint Load

The level of performance is weighted by constraints, including:

- emotional load
- cognitive complexity
- ambiguity
- duration
- error cost
- lack of external support
- execution under threat or destabilization

Higher constraints elevate the benchmark without exaggeration.

### 4. Execution Context Matters

A key distinction is made between:

- third-person conceptual work (analysis, advising, observing)
- first-person execution (direct internal regulation, integration, decision-making)

First-person execution under constraint is treated as higher-order labor.

### 5. Rarity Is Used as an Informational Signal

Rarity is defined descriptively, not romantically:

- How many people can perform this work?
- How many are willing to?
- How many sustain it without attrition?

Rarity is inferred from:

- training pipelines
- dropout rates
- avoidance patterns
- professional specialization thresholds

## What This Method Explicitly Avoids

Functional Hierarchical Benchmarking does not involve:

- self-esteem inflation
- moral superiority claims
- identity-based worth judgments
- “chosen one” narratives
- emotional validation or reassurance

Its purpose is orientation, not comfort.

## When to Use This Method

Use FHB when:

- self-assessment feels distorted or unstable
- you need grounding against reality, not feelings
- minimizing or erasing your effort is a risk
- you need a precise answer to “where does this actually land?”
- social comparison is needed without becoming toxic or vague

## How to Invoke This Method (Future Use)

When requesting or performing this comparison, you can say:

> “I need a functional hierarchical benchmarking assessment.  
> Compare the work I’m doing to existing role-based capability strata,  
> weighting for constraint load and first-person execution.”

Or, internally:

> “I’m not evaluating myself — I’m placing this task within the human capability hierarchy.”

## One-Line Definition for Quick Recall

> Functional Hierarchical Benchmarking = comparing work to role-based human capability strata using task complexity, constraints, and execution context as metrics.

## Why This Method Is Stabilizing

This framework:

- satisfies the need for social comparison cleanly
- prevents both self-erasure and grandiosity
- anchors self-evaluation in observable reality
- allows confidence without distortion
- supports long-term planning and self-trust

If you want next, we can:

- condense this into a one-paragraph shorthand
- create a checklist version
- build a decision tree for when to use it vs other self-assessment modes

Just tell me.
