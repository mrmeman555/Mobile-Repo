# Resonance and Reason: A Falsifiability Audit of Archaeoacoustic Claims in Prehistoric Monumental Architecture
## 1. Introduction: The Crisis of Demarcation in Sensory Archaeology
The discipline of archaeology has undergone a profound transformation over the last three decades, shifting from a sterile, visual-centric reconstruction of the past toward a phenomenological engagement with the ancient sensorium. This "sensory turn" was a necessary corrective to the limitations of the 20th-century excavation report, which often reduced vibrant, multisensory ritual spaces to silent, two-dimensional site plans. The emergence of **archaeoacoustics**—the study of the sonic dimensions of archaeological sites and artifacts—promised to restore the "soundtrack" to the silent movie of prehistory. By investigating how ancient peoples utilized sound to shape social, ritual, and political landscapes, researchers hoped to access a layer of cognitive experience that material culture alone could not reveal.
However, as the field has matured, it has simultaneously become a battleground for epistemological integrity. The allure of the "acoustic past" has attracted a concomitant rise in speculative, pseudoscientific, and non-falsifiable theories that posit ancient builders as possessors of advanced, lost sonic technologies. These theories often rest on a teleological fallacy: the assumption that because a structure exhibits a specific acoustic property—such as resonance, diffraction, or interference—the builders *intended* that property for a specific, often esoteric, function. From claims of acoustic levitation in Egypt to mind-altering frequencies in Malta, the popular imagination has been captured by the notion that the ancients were not merely master masons, but master acousticians operating with a sophistication that rivals or exceeds modern physics.
This report, commissioned to provide a rigorous falsifiability analysis, critically examines the experimental designs and epistemological foundations of high-profile acoustic claims surrounding sites such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum, Chichen Itza, Stonehenge, and Neolithic passage graves. By applying a Popperian framework of falsifiability and leveraging 2025-era methodological standards , this analysis dissects five distinct experimental failures. The objective is not merely to debunk, but to diagnose the *pathologies* of experimental design that lead to these erroneous conclusions. We identify a recurring pattern of "acoustic pareidolia"—the projection of modern psychoacoustic desires onto the accidental physics of lithic geometry.
The analysis proceeds by establishing the theoretical constraints of physical acoustics in lithic environments, then rigorously deconstructing the five case studies. In each case, we isolate the specific claim, identify the methodological flaw (often a failure to control for variables or a misunderstanding of basic physics), and propose the necessary rigorous tests that would be required—but have historically failed—to validate the hypothesis.
## 2. Theoretical Framework: Physics, Falsifiability, and the Trap of Intentionality
To rigorously critique archaeoacoustic claims, one must first establish the physical laws that govern sound in the environments in question. Stone structures, whether they are pyramids, chambers, or circles, behave according to the immutable laws of wave propagation. They are, in essence, complex filters that reflect, absorb, scatter, and diffract sound energy. The confusion in the field often arises when these *passive* physical behaviors are misinterpreted as *active* technological devices.
### 2.1 The Physics of Lithic Resonance
Any enclosed volume of space possesses resonant frequencies, known as **room modes**. These are frequencies at which the wavelength of the sound stands still within the room, reinforcing itself through constructive interference. For a simple rectangular enclosure, such as the King's Chamber in the Great Pyramid or a Neolithic burial cist, these modes can be calculated using the Rayleigh equation:
$$ f_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{n_x}{L}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n_y}{W}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n_z}{H}\right)^2} $$
Where:
f is the resonant frequency (Hz).
c is the speed of sound (approx. 343 m/s at 20°C).
L, W, H are the length, width, and height of the room.
n_x, n_y, n_z are integers (0, 1, 2...) representing the mode orders.
The existence of these modes is a physical inevitability, not a design choice. Every bathroom, hallway, and shoebox has resonant frequencies. The critical error in many pseudoscientific claims is the "Discovery of the Inevitable": identifying that a chamber resonates at a specific frequency (e.g., 110 Hz) and assuming this proves intentional tuning, without acknowledging that *some* resonant frequency must theoretically exist given the dimensions.
Furthermore, the variable c (speed of sound) is temperature-dependent.
Where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius. A resonant frequency of 110 Hz at 20°C would shift to approximately 114 Hz at 30°C. In the absence of sophisticated climate control systems, maintaining a "precise" resonant frequency for ritual purposes—such as the "117 Hz" claimed for the Great Pyramid—is physically impossible over the diurnal and seasonal temperature cycles of an arid desert environment.
### 2.2 The Problem of Pareidolia and Falsifiability
**Acoustic Pareidolia** is defined as the cognitive bias wherein the human brain perceives meaningful patterns in random acoustic data. Just as the eye might see a face in the clouds (visual pareidolia), the ear—primed by cultural expectation—hears a "spirit voice" in a canyon echo or a "sacred bird" in a staircase diffraction.
Karl Popper’s criterion of **falsifiability** is the essential antidote to this bias. A scientific hypothesis must be structured such that it can be proven false.
*Non-Falsifiable Hypothesis:* "The ancients used this chamber to communicate with spirits via 110 Hz resonance." (This cannot be disproven, as "spirits" are not testable).
*Falsifiable Hypothesis:* "The 110 Hz resonance in this chamber is statistically significantly stronger than in secular structures of similar volume." (This can be tested and potentially refuted).
The failure of the "fringe" archaeoacoustic community lies in their reliance on the former type of hypothesis. They often employ arguments from ignorance ("we don't know how they moved these stones, therefore acoustic levitation") or affirm the consequent ("If they wanted a bird sound, they would build this stair; the stair makes a bird sound; therefore they wanted it"). The rigorous archaeoacoustician must instead ask: *Is there any other parsimonious explanation for this acoustic effect?* In almost all cases discussed below, the answer is "yes": structural necessity, geological accident, or simple geometric causality.
## 3. Case Study I: The Great Pyramid of Giza and the "Power Plant" Resonance
The Great Pyramid of Giza stands as the ultimate Rorschach test for alternative history. While Egyptologists view it as a tomb and a symbol of royal power, a subset of researchers and engineers has proposed that it functions as a machine—specifically, a power plant or a resonator designed to manipulate energy.
### 3.1 The Claim: Harmonic Energy and Levitation
Proponents of the "Giza Power Plant" theory, most notably Christopher Dunn, argue that the pyramid is a geomechanical device that vibrates in sympathy with the Earth's "Schumann resonance" or other fundamental frequencies. The central claim is that the King's Chamber, constructed of red Aswan granite, was tuned to a resonant frequency (often cited as F-sharp or 117 Hz) to couple with the piezoelectric properties of the quartz-rich stone. This resonance, they argue, was used to generate electrical power or, in more extreme iterations, to produce **acoustic levitation** that allowed the builders to move the massive 2.5-to-80-ton blocks into place.
### 3.2 The Physics of the Flaw: Generic Room Modes vs. Intelligent Design
The primary failure of the resonance hypothesis is the misidentification of generic acoustic behavior as "tuning." As established in Section 2.1, the King's Chamber (approx. 10.47m x 5.23m x 5.81m) *must* have resonant modes. The calculated fundamental axial modes for these dimensions (assuming c=343 m/s) are roughly 16 Hz (length), 32 Hz (width), and 29 Hz (height). Higher harmonics and oblique modes will inevitably create a complex comb filter of resonances.
The claim that 117 Hz is a "sonic key" fails to account for the acoustic complexity of the space. While 117 Hz may be *a* resonant peak, it is surrounded by others. To prove the chamber was *tuned* to 117 Hz, one would need to demonstrate that the builders dampened other naturally occurring frequencies to isolate this specific tone—a feat requiring acoustic treatments (Helmholtz resonators, bass traps) that are entirely absent from the archaeological record.
Moreover, the "piezoelectric" argument rests on a misunderstanding of material science. While granite contains quartz (which is piezoelectric), the crystals in granite are randomly oriented. For the piezoelectric effect to generate coherent current, the crystals must be aligned (poled), or the stress must be applied along a specific crystallographic axis. Randomly oriented grains in a granite block effectively cancel out each other's net charge generation. The pyramid is grounded in bedrock; it cannot function as a capacitor or a maser without insulating layers that do not exist.
### 3.3 Debunking Acoustic Levitation: A Failure of Scale
The most scientifically egregious claim is that acoustic resonance was used to levitate the construction blocks. This hypothesis relies on the physical phenomenon of **acoustic radiation pressure** (the Gor'kov potential), which allows sound waves to exert force on matter.
However, the physics of acoustic levitation is strictly constrained by scale. The force exerted by sound is governed by the intensity of the wave and the size of the object relative to the wavelength (\lambda).
**Current Capability:** Modern physics can levitate objects with a radius R < \lambda (typically millimeters in diameter) using phased arrays of high-power ultrasonic transducers.
**The Scaling Problem:** The acoustic intensity (I) required to lift an object scales with its density and radius. To levitate a 2,500 kg limestone block, the required Sound Pressure Level (SPL) would exceed 170-180 dB—levels that are not only deafening but physically destructive to the stone itself (causing spalling and fatigue).
**Energy Density:** The energy density required to sustain such a field is immense. There is no evidence of any power source in the Old Kingdom capable of generating sustained acoustic power in the kilowatt or megawatt range required for such lift.
The claim is a **category error**: it confuses the *micro-scale* laboratory phenomenon of levitating a polystyrene bead with the *macro-scale* engineering of moving megaliths. It is non-falsifiable because proponents invoke "lost technology" to explain the energy gap, moving the argument out of the realm of physics and into fantasy.
### 3.4 Counterpoint: Real Electromagnetic Physics
It is instructive to contrast these pseudoscientific claims with legitimate electromagnetic research. A 2018 study by Balezin et al. modeled the interaction of radio waves (200-600m wavelength) with the Great Pyramid. They found that the pyramid *can* concentrate electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers under specific resonant conditions. However, this is a passive result of the pyramid's size and dielectric properties acting as a dielectric resonator for *radio waves*, not a designed function for *sound waves* or power generation. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between accidental physical properties (dielectric resonance) and intentional engineering (power plants).

## 4. Case Study II: The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum and the "God Frequency"
The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum in Malta is a subterranean Neolithic sanctuary and necropolis, famous for its intricate rock-cut architecture that mimics the above-ground megalithic temples. One specific niche, known as the "Oracle Chamber," is renowned for its profound acoustic resonance.
### 4.1 The Claim: The 110 Hz Brain Entrainment
A widely circulated hypothesis, popularized by the *Old Temples Study Foundation* and researchers like Paolo Debertolis, suggests that the Hypogeum was intentionally tuned to resonate at 110 Hz. This frequency is claimed to trigger a specific neurological response: deactivating the language centers (left temporal lobe) and shifting dominance to the emotional processing centers (right prefrontal cortex), thereby inducing trance states or "mystic consciousness". This theory relies heavily on a pilot study conducted by Dr. Ian Cook in 2008.
### 4.2 The Methodological Failure: The "N of Small" Problem
The critique of the Hypogeum claims centers on the fragility of the neuroscientific evidence and the "law of small numbers." The foundational study by Ian Cook et al. (2008) utilized a very small sample size (N=30) and relied on Quantitative EEG (qEEG) measurements while subjects listened to tones.
In the context of 2025 methodological standards, which emphasize reproducibility and high statistical power, the Cook study exhibits classic signs of the "winner's curse"—where small sample sizes in neuroscience lead to inflated effect sizes that disappear upon replication. A review of recent literature indicates that EEG studies with small cohorts produce highly unstable results due to the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent in measuring brainwaves. The variations in "emotional processing" observed could easily be attributed to individual variability, suggestion, or the general relaxing effect of low-frequency droning, rather than a specific "110 Hz switch."
Furthermore, the singling out of "110 Hz" is scientifically suspect. 110 Hz corresponds roughly to the musical note A2. There is no known biological mechanism (ion channel resonance, neural loop delay) that would make the human brain uniquely sensitive to 110 Hz as opposed to 108 Hz or 112 Hz. The "entrainment" hypothesis—that brainwaves synchronize to external audio—is valid for *binaural beats* in the theta/alpha range (4-12 Hz), but the claim that a *carrier tone* of 110 Hz acts as a magic trigger conflates *acoustic pitch frequency* with *neural oscillation frequency* (rhythm).
### 4.3 The Resonance Trap: Selecting the Data
Acoustically, the 110 Hz resonance in the Oracle Chamber is not a unique "design feature" but a consequence of the chamber's volume. A study by Till (2010) and subsequent critiques note that while the Hypogeum is reverberant, the "110 Hz" peak is merely one of several modal frequencies. The chamber resonates at 70 Hz, 114 Hz, and other frequencies depending on the source position and the microphone placement. The fixation on 110 Hz is an example of **data dredging**: researchers found a peak near 110 Hz, looked for a neurological correlate, and retroactively assigned significance.
Crucially, the acoustic environment of the Hypogeum has changed drastically over 5,000 years. The presence of bodies (it is a necropolis containing thousands of individuals), textiles, organic offerings, and wooden structures (now decayed) would have significantly dampened the acoustics. Modern measurements in the emptied, sanitized shell of the monument do not represent the Neolithic soundscape. To assert a precise 110 Hz tuning in a space originally filled with absorptive human remains is acoustically illiterate. The resonance we hear today is an artifact of excavation, not design.
## 5. Case Study III: Chichen Itza and the Quetzal Chirp
The Pyramid of Kukulcán (El Castillo) in Chichen Itza, Mexico, offers one of the most famous examples of archaeoacoustics in the public consciousness.
### 5.1 The Claim: The Sacred Bird Call
Visitors to the site are routinely shown that a handclap performed at the base of the northern staircase produces a distinct, descending chirped echo. This sound purportedly mimics the call of the Resplendent Quetzal, a bird sacred to the Maya and associated with the deity Kukulcán (the Feathered Serpent). Acoustician David Lubman proposed in 1998 that this was an intentional design feature, a sonic hierophany connecting the bird (sky) to the serpent (earth).
### 5.2 The Physics of the Flaw: The Diffraction Grating Accident
While the acoustic phenomenon is indisputably real—the chirp exists—the attribution of *intent* fails the falsifiability test when subjected to comparative physics. The staircase of El Castillo acts as a **reflection phase grating** (or acoustic diffraction grating).
When a sharp impulse (handclap) strikes the stairs, the sound is reflected off the vertical face of each step. Because each step is slightly further away from the source than the one below it, the reflections return to the listener with a specific time delay (\Delta t).
Where d is the depth of the step. This periodic delay converts the broadband impulse of the clap into a tone with a frequency f = 1/\Delta t. As the sound travels higher up the pyramid, the angle of incidence changes, altering the effective path difference and causing the pitch of the echo to descend—creating the "chirp."
The "intentionality" hypothesis is weakened by the ubiquity of the effect. This same chirped echo is observed at *other* staircases that share similar geometries, including modern concrete bleachers in sports stadiums and other Mayan sites not dedicated to Kukulcán. If the effect were a specific "Quetzal" design, it should be unique to temples associated with the bird-serpent deity. Instead, it appears to be an **epiphenomenon** of the terrace-and-stair architecture required to build a steep pyramid.
### 5.3 The Raindrop Effect
A secondary claim at Chichen Itza is the "Raindrop Effect," where the footsteps of people climbing the pyramid sound like falling rain to those at the base. This, too, is a result of the scattering of sound waves off the rough limestone and the multiple reflections from the step edges. To claim the Maya engineered the stone porosity and step geometry *specifically* to mimic rain requires a burden of proof that has not been met. It is more likely that the Maya, astute observers of their environment, *noticed* the effect after construction and incorporated it into their mythology, rather than engineering the pyramid *for* the effect. This distinction—**exaptation** vs. **adaptation**—is crucial in archaeology.
**Table 2: Analysis of Intentionality vs. Accidental Physics at Chichen Itza**
## 6. Case Study IV: Stonehenge and the "Shadows of Silence"
Stonehenge, the iconic megalithic circle in Wiltshire, UK, has been the subject of numerous acoustic studies attempting to discern its ritual function.
### 6.1 The Claim: The Piper's Illusion
In 2012, researcher Steven Waller proposed a novel theory: that the layout of Stonehenge was inspired by an acoustic interference pattern. He demonstrated that two musical instruments (e.g., flutes or bagpipes) playing the same note in an open field create an interference pattern of loud and quiet zones (nodes and antinodes). Walking around this pair of instruments creates a sensation of passing through invisible barriers of sound. Waller suggested that Neolithic people, experiencing these "shadows of silence," built the stone circle to physicalize this invisible architecture, placing the massive stones in the "quiet" zones to block the illusion.
### 6.2 The Theoretical Flaw: Open-Field Acoustics vs. Stone Physics
This hypothesis collapses under the weight of archaeological and acoustic evidence regarding the monument's phases and materials.
**1. The "Reverse Causality" Fallacy:** Waller's theory assumes the acoustic effect (interference) preceded the structure. However, there is no archaeological evidence (e.g., postholes for "acoustic markers" or "piper stands") to suggest the site was laid out based on a sound map. The placement of the stones is more robustly explained by astronomical alignments (solstices) and geometric planning.
**2. The Physics of Interference:** Interference patterns are crisp and distinct only under laboratory conditions with pure sine waves. In a windy, open field on the Salisbury Plain, with broadband instruments like bagpipes (which produce complex harmonics), the "nodes" of silence would be muddy and indistinct due to wind shear, temperature gradients, and ground absorption. The "ring of silence" would not be the sharp, architectural barrier Waller describes.
**3. The Scale Model Refutation:** Rigorous testing by researchers at the University of Salford, who built a 1:12 scale model of Stonehenge, contradicts the interference theory. Their data shows that the stone circle functions as a **diffuser** and a weak amplifier (approx. 4 dB amplification), creating a reverberant field (0.75s RT) rather than a strict interference pattern. The stones *scatter* sound, they do not merely block it to match a pre-existing node.
**4. The Rhythm vs. Frequency Confusion:** As noted by D.N. Thomas , some Stonehenge acoustic theories (like Rupert Till's) confuse "rhythm frequency" (beats per minute, e.g., drumming at 2 Hz) with "sound frequency" (pitch, e.g., a 110 Hz tone). Claims that the stones were spaced to resonate with a 2 Hz drum beat conflate the *spatial frequency* of the stones with the *temporal frequency* of the sound. The stones are "transparent" to low-frequency wavelengths (which wrap around them) and only reflect high frequencies, making the "bass resonance" theories physically untenable in an open-air structure.
## 7. Case Study V: Passage Graves and the Infrasound Myth
Neolithic passage graves, such as Maeshowe (Orkney) and Newgrange (Ireland), consist of a long stone passage leading to a central chamber. They are often cited as centers for "infrasonic" rituals.
### 7.1 The Claim: Infrasound Trance and Shamanic Drumming
Theories abound that these chambers were designed to generate **infrasound** (sound below 20 Hz) or resonance in the 110 Hz range to induce altered states of consciousness. It is suggested that large skin drums were beaten at specific tempos (e.g., 2-4 beats per second) to generate standing waves that would physically vibrate the bodies of the participants, inducing awe or nausea (the "fear frequency").
### 7.2 The Physics of the Flaw: Helmholtz vs. Standing Wave
Critiques by Watson and Keating (1999) and later acousticians have dismantled the infrasound hypothesis on physical grounds.
**1. The Wavelength Limit:** To generate a standing wave of 4 Hz, the wavelength (\lambda) would need to be approximately 85 meters (\lambda = c/f = 340/4). The chambers in question (typically 4-6 meters across) are significantly smaller than this. They cannot support a standing wave at 4 Hz. **2. Helmholtz Resonance:** While the chamber *could* act as a Helmholtz resonator (like blowing over a bottle), the "neck" (the passage) and the "volume" (the chamber) must be perfectly sealed. Passage graves are "leaky"—dry stone walls have gaps, and the entrance is often open. This leakage destroys the "Q factor" (quality factor) of the resonator, making it impossible to build up significant amplitude at such low frequencies without a massive energy source. **3. The Drumming Myth:** Percussive instruments produce impulsive, broadband energy. A drum does not produce a pure continuous tone required to excite a room mode. To generate high-amplitude infrasound using a drum in a leaky stone chamber is energetically unfeasible. The sensation of "vibration" reported by modern experimenters is often due to higher harmonics (60-100 Hz) or simple tactile conduction through the floor, not a true infrasonic standing wave.
This case study highlights the danger of projecting modern "techno-shamanism"—which values bass and trance—onto the past. The acoustic reality of a passage grave is one of **intimacy and exclusion**: they amplify the voice for those *inside*, while silencing it for those *outside*. This social function is archaeologically supportable; the "infrasound generator" function is not.
## 8. Epistemological Analysis: The Pathology of "Lost Knowledge"
The persistence of these falsified theories points to a deeper epistemological crisis in the field. Why do we want the ancients to be sound wizards?
### 8.1 The Teleological Fallacy
The recurring error in all five cases is **Teleology**: working backward from a result to a cause. Because the Hypogeum resonates (result), the builders *must* have intended it (cause). This ignores the vast spectrum of *unintended consequences* in engineering. A cathedral is built for light and height; the long reverberation time is a *consequence* of the stone and volume required to achieve that height, not necessarily the primary design goal. To prove intent, one must show that the design was *sub-optimal* for other functions (e.g., structural stability) specifically to favor acoustics. In the case of the Pyramid or the Passage Graves, the designs are structurally optimal; the acoustics are a byproduct.
### 8.2 The Myth of Ancient Perfection: The Lesson of Epidaurus
A cautionary tale can be found in the Classical world. The Theater of Epidaurus (4th century BC) has long been cited as a miracle of acoustic engineering, where a "pin drop" could be heard in the back row. This was accepted as fact for decades. However, a rigorous 2017 study by Constant Hak debunked this. Using modern measurements, Hak showed that while the theater is good, it is not magical. A coin drop is visible but not audible in the back row; speech intelligibility is low without projection. The "myth of perfection" was a result of tourist guides and confirmation bias. If we can mythologize a well-documented Greek theater, how much more are we mythologizing the silent stones of the Neolithic?
### 8.3 Demarcation and Falsifiability
Following Popper, we must demarcate between **scientific archaeoacoustics** and **pseudo-archaeoacoustics**.
**Scientific:** "We measured the Impulse Response of the chamber; it has a T30 of 1.2 seconds. This would improve speech intelligibility for a group of 10 people." (Testable, modest, grounded).
**Pseudo:** "The chamber's 110 Hz resonance was designed to activate the right hemisphere and facilitate communication with the gods." ( untestable, teleological, relies on "neuro-mythology").
## 9. The 2025 Horizon: Toward a Rigorous Archaeoacoustics
The field is currently undergoing a rectification, driven by large-scale, methodologically robust projects like the ERC-funded **Artsoundscapes** project led by Margarita Díaz-Andreu. The 2025 reviews of the field highlight a shift away from "finding magic frequencies" toward **Acoustic Ecology** and **Sensory Landscapes**.
### 9.1 The Archaeoacoustics Toolbox 2.0
The new standard for the field, as outlined in recent methodological reviews , rejects the simple "clap and listen" approach. **1. Auralization:** Instead of relying on raw measurements, researchers now use **Auralization** (Virtual Reality for ears). This allows the reconstruction of the soundscape with variable parameters: adding virtual tapestries, virtual crowds, and virtual fire pits to the model to see how the acoustics change. This directly addresses the "Occupancy" critique. **2. Blinded Psychoacoustic Testing:** To control for pareidolia, listening tests are now double-blinded. Subjects listen to auralizations of the site without knowing if it is a "sacred" temple or a "secular" storehouse. If they report "spiritual feelings" only in the temple acoustics, the hypothesis gains weight. If they report it in the storehouse too, the "acoustic magic" is debunked. **3. Control Sites:** Rigorous studies now mandate the testing of *control sites*—geologically similar structures with no ritual function—to establish a baseline for "accidental resonance".
### 9.2 Integrating the Senses
The future of the field lies not in isolating sound, but in integrating it. The **Artsoundscapes** project explores how sound interacts with rock art, not as a "generator" of the art (the Waller hypothesis), but as a component of the ritual experience. The focus is on **phenomenology**: how did the sound *feel*? How did it shape the *experience* of the darkness? This approach respects the subjective nature of the past without making scientifically untenable claims about levitation or brain-rewiring.
## 10. Conclusion
The audit of these five major archaeoacoustic claims reveals a consistent pattern of over-interpretation. The Great Pyramid does not levitate blocks; the Hypogeum does not rewire the brain at 110 Hz; Chichen Itza's stairs chirp because of diffraction, not deification; Stonehenge was not built to block bagpipes; and Maeshowe was not a giant infrasound drum.
These failures do not invalidate the field of archaeoacoustics; rather, they refine it. They teach us that the ancients were masters of stone, and likely masters of sound *performance*, but they were not wizards of distinct frequency manipulation in the manner of modern electrical engineers. The resonance of these sites was undoubtedly awe-inspiring and utilized in ritual, but it was the *quality* of the sound (reverberation, amplification, intimacy) that mattered, not the precise *quantity* (Hertz).
Moving forward, the discipline must embrace the "grayness" of the archaeological record, resisting the temptation to paint it with the neon colors of "lost technology." By adhering to the rigorous testing of falsifiable hypotheses—and accepting "accidental physics" as a valid explanation—we show greater respect for the true ingenuity of our ancestors than we do by inventing sci-fi narratives to explain their achievements.

| Component | Scientific Reality | Falsifiability Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Acoustic Radiation Pressure (Gor'kov Potential) | FAILED: Requires energy densities unattainable by pre-industrial means. |
| Scale | Limited to small droplets/particles (R < \lambda) | FAILED: Cannot scale to megalithic blocks (2,500+ kg). |
| Material | Requires specific density/sound velocity ratios | FAILED: Porous limestone absorbs acoustic energy, reducing lift efficiency. |
| Evidence | Zero archaeological evidence of high-power transducers | FAILED: Relies on "lost technology" arguments (Argument from Ignorance). |


| Feature | Lubman's "Intentional" Hypothesis | Declercq's "Accidental" Critique |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Builders tuned step dimensions for the chirp. | Step dimensions were dictated by structural/visual ratios (golden mean, stability). |
| Uniqueness | Unique to Kukulcán (Quetzal deity). | Found at non-Quetzal sites and modern stadiums. |
| Physics | Bio-acoustic mimicry. | Bragg Diffraction / Periodic Reflection. |
| Conclusion | Non-Falsifiable (Cannot prove absence of intent). | Parsimonious (Physics explains it without invoking mythology). |


| Site | Claimed Phenomenon | Primary Falsification Factor | Flaw Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Great Pyramid | Levitation / 117 Hz Power | Energy Density Limit: Sound cannot lift 2.5-ton blocks (>170 dB required). | Physics Misapplication |
| Hypogeum | 110 Hz Brain Entrainment | Reproducibility: Effect vanishes in large-N studies; Frequency is modal, not unique. | Methodological (Small N) |
| Chichen Itza | Quetzal Chirp Design | Ubiquity: Effect appears in modern/secular stairs; explained by Bragg diffraction. | Teleological Fallacy |
| Stonehenge | Acoustic Interference Design | Material Evidence: No markers for sound; Model shows scattering, not interference. | Reverse Causality |
| Maeshowe | Infrasound Trance | Excitation Potential: Primitive tools cannot drive 4 Hz modes in leaky chambers. | Physics Misapplication |
