# Appendix B: Annotated Bibliography of the Lithic Circuit

The following annotated bibliography provides the source verification for the "Omni-Specialist Protocol." It audits the primary datasets used to establish the Bayesian Likelihood Ratios ($P(E|H)$) for the "Lithic Circuit" hypothesis versus the Conventional model.

(1983).** "Ancient Egyptian Stone-Drilling: An Experimental Perspective on a Scholarly Disagreement." *Expedition*, 25(3), 40-47. | Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed that loose sand creates pitted marks, while fixed/slurry abrasives create concentric striations. | **Critical falsification:** Physically distinguishes between "primitive" loose sand ($H_0$) and advanced fixed-tooling ($H_1$) via micro-topography. |
| **[3, 4]** | **Dunn, C. (2010).** *Lost Technologies of Ancient Egypt: Advanced Engineering in the Temples of the Pharaohs*. Bear & Company. pp. 133-140. | Documented the 0.0002-inch (5 micron) surface flatness and 4mm internal corner radius of the Serapeum boxes using precision straight-edges. | **Establishes $P(E|H_1)$:** Defines the "impossible" geometric precision that lowers the probability of the hand-lapping hypothesis ($H_0$). |
| **[5]** | **Mariette, A. (1882).** *Le Sérapéum de Memphis*. Publié d'après le manuscrit de l'auteur par G. Maspero. Paris: F. Vieweg. | The primary archaeological report detailing the discovery of the Serapeum and the granite sarcophagi in situ. | **Contextual Baseline:** Establishes the accepted provenance and orthodox attribution of the artifacts to the Apis Bull cult. |
| **[6]** | **Isida Project. (2013).** "Measurements of the Serapeum Sarcophagi." *Expedition Reports, Egypt*. | Independent digital inclinometer surveys showing variances in some boxes (angles of 91.2°, 92.4°) compared to Dunn's precision measurements. | **Variance Control:** Introduces necessary error bars to the model, suggesting a mix of "High Spec" and "Low Spec" units rather than uniform perfection. |
| **[7, 8]** | **Stocks, D.A. (2003).** *Experiments in Egyptian Archaeology: Stoneworking Technology in Ancient Egypt*. Routledge. pp. 105-111. | Experimental replication proved copper tubes and sand *can* drill granite, but with high copper loss and slow feed rates. | **Defines $P(E|H_0)$:** Provides the upper limit of what conventional tools can achieve, serving as the "Null Hypothesis" baseline. |
| **[9, 10]** | **Petrie, W.M.F. (1883).** *The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh*. London: Field & Tuer. p. 75. | Identified the continuous spiral groove on "Core #7" with a pitch of 0.100 inches (2.54mm) per revolution. | **The "Smoking Gun":** The 0.100" feed rate measurement remains the primary tribological anomaly challenging the friction-drilling model. |
| **[11]** | **Danley, T. (Cited in Dunn, 1998; Childress, 2000).** *Acoustic Tests in the Great Pyramid*. (Documented in *FATE Magazine* & *The Giza Power Plant*). | Measured infrasonic vibrations (0.5 Hz - 16 Hz) caused by wind passing over the air shafts, creating a "Helmholtz" effect. | **Functional Mechanics:** Validates the "active machine" hypothesis ($H_1$) by identifying a passive power source (wind) for the acoustic system. |

(2018).** "Electromagnetic properties of the Great Pyramid: First multipole resonances and energy concentration." *Journal of Applied Physics*, 124(3). | Computer modeling demonstrated the Great Pyramid concentrates electromagnetic energy in the King's Chamber under resonance conditions. | **Theoretical Plausibility:** Provides modern physics validation for the "energy concentration" claims of the Lithic Circuit hypothesis. |
| **[14]** | **Gomez-Heras, M. et al. (2006).** "Petrophysical properties of Aswan Granite." *Geological Society, London*. | Details the piezoelectric potential and crystallographic anisotropy of Aswan Rose Granite. | **Material Constraints:** Defines the physical limits of the "substrate," confirming quartz content but highlighting the randomization of crystal orientation. |
