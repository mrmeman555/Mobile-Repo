# 🏗️ Lithic Circuit: Development Roadmap

## 🎛️ Nexus Command Expansion
- [ ] **Deep Integration (Total Sync):**
    - Ensure *every* variable in *every* module (including speculative v2.0 features) is linked to the Global State.
    - Audit the "Bayesian Verdict" module to see if it can be driven by the Dashboard (e.g., auto-updating priors based on simulation results).

- [ ] **Omni-Visualization Deck:**
    - Port local visualizations to the Global Dashboard.
    - [ ] **Giza:** 3D Resonance Chamber view.
    - [ ] **Hawara:** Joukowsky Pressure Curve.
    - [ ] **Serapeum:** Phononic Band Gap chart.
    - *Goal:* Allow the user to see the "Physics Impact" charts side-by-view without leaving the Command Center.

- [ ] **Diagnostic Visualizer (The "Why" Engine):**
    - Create a "System Health" view that goes beyond Green/Red nodes.
    - Implement **Root Cause Logic**:
        - *Example:* If "Flow Stability" is Low, display: "⚠️ FAILURE CAUSE: Freshwater Corrosion (TDS < 67 g/L) is destabilizing the Valve Farm."
    - Add a "Troubleshooter" wizard that suggests the exact slider move to fix the bottleneck.

## 🧪 The Proving Ground (Testing)
- [ ] **Scenario Runner (Batch Testing):**
    - Create a new page or tab for "Automated Testing."
    - **Playlist:** Allow users to queue up multiple JSON configs (e.g., "Freshwater", "Seawater", "Brine").
    - **Execution:** Run them sequentially.
    - **Report:** Generate a comparative table showing Uptime/Stability for each case.
    - *Goal:* Mathematically prove the "Optimal Configuration" through batch analysis.
