# Lithic Circuit Simulation

**Mission:** Validating the Giza Power Plant hypothesis via Bayesian Inference and Physical Modeling.

## Overview
This project simulates the Great Pyramid (Giza), the Serapeum, and the Hawara Labyrinth as components of a distributed industrial machine.

## Modules
- **Giza Generator:** Resonant acoustics (Strouhal/Helmholtz).
- **Serapeum Capacitor:** LRSM (Locally Resonant Sonic Materials) and geometric capacitance.
- **Hawara Regulator:** Hydraulic Pulse and Piezoelectric conversion.
- **Global Network:** Geomagnetic field dependence (Laschamp Event simulation).
- **Bayesian Verdict:** Statistical analysis of the "Advanced Machine" hypothesis.

## Usage
Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run lithic_simulation/app.py
```
