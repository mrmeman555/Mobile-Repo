**Goal:**
Reframe "rustiness" in manual coding as "modern efficiency" and architectural focus.

**The Narrative Shift:**

* **The Trap (Do Not Say):** "I haven't coded in a while, so I rely on AI."
    * *Why:* Implies atrophy, dependency, and weakness.

* **The Winning Frame (Say This):** "I have transitioned to **AI-Augmented Development**."
    * "I leverage my coding background to **architect complex systems** and valid logic."
    * "I use tools like Cursor to **execute syntax at 10x speed**, allowing me to focus on high-level problem solving and system design."
    * "I am an **outcome-focused builder**, not just a syntax writer."

**Why This Works:**
* It positions you as **cutting-edge**, not "rusty."
* It highlights **efficiency** and **architectural thinking**.
* It turns the use of tools (Cursor) into a **force multiplier**, not a crutch.
