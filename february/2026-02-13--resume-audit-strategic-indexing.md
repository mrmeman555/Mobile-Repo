**Goal:**
To transform the resume from a list of "things I should know" into a tactical study map, applying the "Strategic Indexing" protocol.

**The Method:**
Go through the resume line-by-line (every tool, language, and skill listed) and assign one of three tags.

**The Tags:**

1.  **[Deep Dive]** (The Kernel)
    * **Criteria:** Foundational technologies (e.g., Networking, Linux, core Cloud concepts) or primary skills for target roles.
    * **Action:** These require active study and understanding of the "how" and "why."

2.  **[Familiarize]** (The Pointer)
    * **Criteria:** Specific tools, legacy systems, or secondary skills.
    * **Action:** Refresh memory on what it does, the basic vocabulary, and use cases. Ideally, be able to speak about it for 1-2 minutes. No need for deep technical mastery right now.

3.  **[Ignore]** (Deprecate)
    * **Criteria:** Outdated tech, irrelevant to current goals, or things you don't want to do anymore.
    * **Action:** Acknowledge it's there, but devote zero energy to it.

**Execution:**
* Do not study *while* auditing. Just tag.
* Be ruthless. You cannot [Deep Dive] everything.
* This creates the syllabus for the "High Speed Study System."
