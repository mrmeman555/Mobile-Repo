**Context:**
Shift from "Anxiety-Driven Learning" (trying to memorize the entire database of IT knowledge) to "Strategic Indexing" (building a mental map of where information lives).

**The Core Shift:**
* **Old Model:** "I must know everything deeply to be safe." (Impossible, high energy cost).
* **New Model:** "I must know *of* things to be competent." (Achievable, energy efficient).

**The Protocol:**

1.  **Conversational Familiarity (The Pointer)**
    * **Goal:** Pass the "sniff test" in interviews.
    * **Action:** Review tools/concepts enough to know *what* they do and the *vocabulary* surrounding them.
    * **Mental State:** Recognition memory (Low energy).

2.  **Deep Dives (The Kernel)**
    * **Goal:** Fundamental structural competence.
    * **Action:** Select specific, foundational topics (e.g., Networking, TCP/IP, DNS) to master deeply.
    * **Logic:** If you understand the plumbing, you can figure out the faucet.

3.  **Just-In-Time Compilation (The Job)**
    * **Goal:** specific implementation.
    * **Action:** Learn the specific syntax/config *only* when the job demands it.
    * **Logic:** Don't cache heavy files in RAM until necessary.

**Biological Justification:**
* **Ferritin/Energy Conservation:** "Deep learning" everything burns massive glucose. Indexing relies on lighter cognitive loads.
* **Anxiety Reduction:** Removes the impossible standard of "knowing it all" before applying.

**Interview Reality:**
* Employers hire for **Fundamental Grasp** + **Resourcefulness** (AI skills/Research), not encyclopedic recall.
