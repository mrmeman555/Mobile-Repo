## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-08 — [Pipeline-First Strategy, Optionality, and Confidence-Based Allocation (YouTube + Certs)](./2026-01-08--pipeline-first-optionality-and-confidence-based-allocation-youtube-and-certs.md) — Frames the pipeline as the unit of control; defines MCO as repeatable high-quality throughput; uses signal-based, guilt-free reallocation between certs and channel (e.g., revenue thresholds) to preserve optionality and reduce identity stakes/DPDR loops. (Tags: pipeline; optionality; YouTube; certs; allocation; MCO; thresholds)
- 2026-01-08 — [PoE YouTube Project – Minimum Viable Entry & Upper-Bound Design](./2026-01-08--poe-youtube-project-minimum-viable-entry-and-upper-bound-design.md) — Frames YouTube as Phase 1 distribution surface; defines MVP as a sustainable pipeline (not content), with minimal entry (one promise, one format, 3–5 buffer, success=system integrity) and an upper-bound–preserving decision rule (“keep doors open”). (Tags: YouTube; leverage; pipeline; MVP; strategy)
