# PoE index

This index tracks everything stored in `PoE/`.

## How to use

- Add new PoE notes as individual markdown files in this folder.
- Any time a new note is added, **update this index** with:
  - Title (as a link)
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags

## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-08 — [Framework for Assessing the YouTube Space (Discovery & Analysis Phase)](./2026-01-08--framework-for-assessing-the-youtube-space-discovery-and-analysis-phase.md) — Defines what to log before MVP: niche/sub-niche decomposition, value angles, channel repetition signals, monetization funnels, algorithm-aware performance patterns, and cross-channel opportunity extraction (constraints, uncontested spaces, fragile dominance). (Tags: YouTube; PoE; discovery; demand mapping; competition; algorithm; monetization)
- 2026-01-08 — [The Deep-Research-Driven Confidence Pipeline](./2026-01-08--the-deep-research-driven-confidence-pipeline.md) — Universal next-step engine: context saturation → constraint isolation → signal extraction with recursive meta-research (“what context would make this answerable?”), selecting best-next-step by option value; turns ambiguity into inquiry and confidence into procedure. (Tags: research; decision engine; recursion; meta; optionality; confidence)
- 2026-01-08 — [Meta-Directed Deep Research Framework](./2026-01-08--meta-directed-deep-research-framework.md) — End-to-end research pipeline (objectives → meta-criteria → questions → signals → decision → execution) that preserves optionality, prevents premature commitment, and converts uncertainty into bounded inquiry before MVP work. (Tags: research; meta; criteria; signals; decision; optionality; pipeline)
- 2026-01-08 — [Pipeline-First Strategy, Optionality, and Confidence-Based Allocation (YouTube + Certs)](./2026-01-08--pipeline-first-optionality-and-confidence-based-allocation-youtube-and-certs.md) — Frames the pipeline as the unit of control; defines MCO as repeatable high-quality throughput; uses signal-based, guilt-free reallocation between certs and channel (e.g., revenue thresholds) to preserve optionality and reduce identity stakes/DPDR loops. (Tags: pipeline; optionality; YouTube; certs; allocation; MCO; thresholds)
- 2026-01-08 — [PoE YouTube Project – Minimum Viable Entry & Upper-Bound Design](./2026-01-08--poe-youtube-project-minimum-viable-entry-and-upper-bound-design.md) — Frames YouTube as Phase 1 distribution surface; defines MVP as a sustainable pipeline (not content), with minimal entry (one promise, one format, 3–5 buffer, success=system integrity) and an upper-bound–preserving decision rule (“keep doors open”). (Tags: YouTube; leverage; pipeline; MVP; strategy)
