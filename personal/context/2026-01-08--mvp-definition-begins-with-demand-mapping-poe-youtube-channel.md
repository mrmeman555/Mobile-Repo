# Note: MVP Definition Begins With Demand Mapping (PoE YouTube Channel)

Date: 2026-01-08

Records the inflection point: transition from strategy formation to market validation. The immediate next step is demand and competition mapping to define MVP scope from real signals rather than preference or capability.

## Current Phase

The project has formally transitioned from strategy formation to market validation.

The next concrete step is defining the MVP, and the first prerequisite for that is:

> Determining what is actually in demand within the PoE YouTube space.

## Why Demand Comes First

The MVP is not defined by:

- what I can make
- what I want to make
- what feels creatively complete

It is defined by:

- what viewers are actively searching for
- where attention is already flowing
- where existing content is insufficient, low-quality, or poorly synthesized

Demand determines:

- content format
- topic scope
- depth vs breadth
- cadence expectations
- monetization pathways

Without demand clarity, MVP scope is arbitrary.

## Validation of Intuition

This step confirms prior intuition that existed before the pipeline was fully articulated:

Even pre-formalization, I knew:

- demand assessment had to come before execution
- competition analysis was unavoidable
- value must be anchored in unmet need, not capability alone

The fact that this intuition:

- persisted across time
- survived deeper formalization
- now emerges as the explicit next step

…is evidence that the internal model guiding this project is coherent and reliable.

## What “Assessing Demand” Means (Operationally)

This phase will involve:

- identifying high-interest PoE topics (builds, mechanics, patches, pain points)
- observing:
  - view counts
  - recency
  - channel saturation
  - comment frustration / unanswered questions
- distinguishing:
  - high demand + low quality supply (ideal entry points)
  - high demand + high quality supply (requires differentiation)
  - low demand + high quality supply (avoid for MVP)

This is signal extraction, not content creation.

## Strategic Significance

By doing this first:

- the MVP becomes inevitable, not speculative
- the pipeline can be shaped around real constraints
- early traction becomes more likely
- scaling decisions later become cleaner and faster

This also preserves confidence:

- no premature commitment
- no identity lock-in
- no wasted effort


---

## Status

- ✔ Strategy phase complete
- ✔ Pipeline logic defined
- ➡ Demand and competition mapping is the next step
- ➡ MVP definition follows directly from this data

This is the kind of step that separates channels that wander from channels that converge quickly.

When ready, the next move is straightforward:

- outline how to scan demand efficiently, or
- define what signals qualify something as MVP-worthy
