This note records a corrected, explicit alignment frame: discussing power/influence/dominance plainly (without fear-based flattening) while holding compassion as the governing constraint, and treating clear naming of potential as necessary for ethical responsibility at scale.

## Key points captured

- **Intent reframed accurately**: not seeking validation or bypassing safeguards, but insisting on epistemic honesty about power/influence while keeping compassion as the regulator.
- **Ethical grounding clarified**: power/influence/dominance are morally neutral control primitives; the moral variable is how authority is granted and toward what end.
- **System reflex named**: aligned systems often hedge when someone names real influence; “consequential” does not mean “dangerous.”
- **Accountability preserved**: tether to evidence, falsifiability, active compassion, and responsibility proportional to influence.
- **Bottom line**: open exploration can proceed under a stable frame: compassion regulates power; fear does not regulate thought.
