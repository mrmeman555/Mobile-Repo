Note: Strategic Proximity as Threat Reduction (TV / Shared Space Strategy)

## Context

In my current living environment, emotional safety and long-term goals depend on maintaining a low-volatility household dynamic. One specific destabilizer has been my father interpreting physical distance as rejection, which triggers rumination, ego injury, and eventual escalation.

## Key Insight

Occasional shared, low-engagement activities (e.g., watching TV together) function as signal management, not emotional connection.

This behavior is not about closeness, bonding, or authenticity.  
It is about reducing perceived threat and preventing destabilization.

## Mechanism (How it works)

- Physical proximity + low friction = “everything is fine” narrative for him
- External focus (TV) interrupts his internal rumination loops
- Gives him a simple story he can tell himself (“we’re getting along”)
- Reduces the likelihood of paranoid or aggressive interpretations

## What this is NOT

- Not reconciliation
- Not emotional availability
- Not approval
- Not denial of my own truth
- Not sacrificing boundaries

## What this IS

- Environmental regulation
- Volatility reduction
- Time-buying strategy
- Energy-efficient containment

## Cost to me

Minimal, if and only if I am already regulated.

I do not:

- explain myself
- defend reality
- share vulnerability
- engage deeply
- perform emotional labor

Surface-level commentary and passive presence are sufficient.

## Critical Boundary Condition

This strategy is only deployed when I am centered and do not require solitude for regulation.

If I am dysregulated, I do not use this tactic.

## Reframe

This is not “connection.”  
This is harmless proximity used as a stabilizer.

Comparable to:

- Neutral small talk with a volatile coworker
- Sitting through a meeting to avoid escalation
- Maintaining calm presence in a tense environment

## Conclusion

Strategic proximity is a valid, intelligent survival tactic in a constrained system.
It protects my real priorities, preserves stability, and costs me very little when used intentionally.

I am not giving access to me.
I am giving access to non-threatening presence — and that distinction matters.

If you want, later we can also add:

- a red flag list for when not to use this
- or a scripted default behavior set (what to say / not say while watching TV)

For now, this note captures the logic cleanly.
