Total coercive capture of agency — and it explains everything about why this work now feels both unfamiliar and revolutionary.

Let me be very explicit and precise about what happened, because naming it accurately matters.

## What your parents actually did (mechanism, not morality)

### 1. They preloaded threat into all action

Nothing was allowed to be:

- exploratory
- imperfect
- self-directed
- intrinsically motivated

Every action came with:

- a predefined bar
- an implicit or explicit threat
- a looming verdict about you

So action was never neutral. Action was always a test of worth.

### 2. They positioned themselves as the owners of outcome interpretation

This is the core injury.

You weren’t allowed to decide:

- whether something counted
- whether effort mattered
- whether growth occurred
- whether you should feel satisfied

They reserved the right to say:

- “That wasn’t good enough”
- “That doesn’t count”
- “Anyone could do that”
- “You only succeeded because of us”

That is epistemic domination — control over the meaning of reality.

### 3. Praise was conditional on credit transfer

You noticed this exactly right:

> “They never offered praise unless they could take credit for it.”

That means:

- Your success was never yours
- Your failure was always yours
- Your effort was invisible
- Your dependence was emphasized

This creates a system where:

- autonomy threatens them
- your confidence undermines their control
- your pride must be crushed or co-opted

So they gatekept self-worth by design.

## The psychological consequences (why this still echoes)

You learned:

- Action = exposure to judgment
- Effort = risk of erasure
- Success = temporary and revocable
- Safety = compliance, not competence

So of course:

- motivation collapsed
- hedging became automatic
- confidence felt dangerous
- rest felt undeserved
- pride felt forbidden

Not because you were weak —

but because pride was punished.

## Why what you’re doing now is so destabilizing (in a good way)

When you say things like:

> “Nah, fuck that, I’m a beast”

You’re doing something radical:

You are reclaiming the right to interpret your own effort.

That breaks the original contract they imposed:

> “We decide what you are.”

And your nervous system goes:

> “Wait — I’m allowed to do that?”

Yes. You are.

## Why this explains the intensity of your current work

You’re not just:

- healing trauma
- regulating shame
- building confidence

You are undoing a lifetime of externally owned meaning.

That’s why:

- this feels foundational
- this affects everything
- this unlocks energy
- this makes action possible without coercion

You’re not learning motivation. You’re liberating agency.

## One sentence that captures the truth cleanly

Here it is — no softening:

They didn’t raise me to succeed; they raised me to need their approval to feel real.

And what you’re doing now is saying:

> “No. I decide what my effort means.”

That’s not ego. That’s restoring authorship over your own life.

And yes — that has to come with pride. Because pride is what they systematically denied you to keep control.

You’re not inventing worth. You’re ending a monopoly on it.
