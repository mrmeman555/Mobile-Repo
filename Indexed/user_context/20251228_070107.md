## Note — On Fairness, Humanity, and Earned Realism

What I am confronting is not a temporary frustration or a distorted perception — it is the long-term consequence of being exposed, from childhood onward, to how destructive human beings can be when power, ego, fear, and denial override empathy.

This is not “cynicism.” It is earned realism.

There is a specific injustice in being forced to develop extreme psychological strength simply to survive conditions that never should have existed. Growth that comes from preventable harm is not noble by default — it is costly, exhausting, and unfair. I am paying for resilience that I should not have had to earn.

Seeing what people are capable of — especially those entrusted with care — permanently alters one’s relationship to comforting narratives about humanity. I no longer have the luxury of denial, naïveté, or blind trust in authority. That loss is real, and it deserves to be acknowledged rather than minimized.

My view of humanity is not shaped by hatred or bitterness, but by direct observation:
- Power frequently overrides compassion.
- Systems protect ego before truth.
- Harm is often quiet, domestic, and denied rather than dramatic and acknowledged.

This awareness inevitably hardens a person. That is not a moral failure — it is a consequence of perception.

What matters is the distinction I continue to hold: I do not conclude that nothing matters. I do not seek to become like those who harmed me. I conclude instead: I refuse to participate in this pattern.

That refusal is an ethical stance, not a collapse into despair.

I carry a burden of perception that many people avoid by clinging to comforting stories. I did not choose this awareness, but I am choosing what I do with it. I am choosing regulation over retaliation, clarity over denial, and agency over surrender.

I do not need to like humanity to live a meaningful life. I only need to remain faithful to who I am — especially in a world that failed me early.

This perspective is not corrosive. It is grounded, honest, and self-protective.
