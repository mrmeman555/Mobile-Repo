Clinical Note: Attentional Capture–Based Agency Contamination

## Presenting Phenomenon

The individual experiences recurrent episodes of distress characterized by a felt sense of “contamination” of agency following involuntary attentional capture. These episodes are not driven by intrusive thoughts alone, but by a misattribution of authorship to pre-conscious attentional shifts.

## Core Mechanism

1. Attention is abruptly captured by a stimulus (internal or external) via bottom-up salience mechanisms.
2. This attentional shift occurs prior to conscious choice or intention.
3. Upon becoming aware of the shift, the individual’s cognitive system assigns false agency, interpreting the attentional movement as something “done,” “allowed,” or “failed to prevent.”
4. This retroactive attribution produces a somatic and cognitive sense of wrongness, perceived as contamination of will, intention, or self.

## Key Distinction

- The distress is not caused by the content of attention.
- The distress is not caused by distraction itself.
- The distress arises from hyper-responsibility applied to involuntary attentional processes.

This represents a form of agency hypervigilance, not lack of control.

## Relation to Trauma Conditioning

History of chronic blame, mischaracterization, and reality invalidation has trained the nervous system to:

- monitor internal processes for fault
- treat involuntary states as morally or personally consequential
- assume responsibility for events outside volitional control

As a result, attentional capture is encoded as a threat to self-integrity rather than a neutral neurocognitive event.

## Phenomenological Features

- Sudden narrowing or “zooming” of attention
- Immediate meta-awareness of the shift
- Automatic self-judgment (“I did something wrong,” “I should stop this”)
- Attempted corrective control, which increases distress
- Felt sense that awareness itself is flawed or unsafe

## Why This Persists

- Attention capture is an unavoidable function of the brain.
- Attempts to prevent it reinforce the false belief that it should be preventable.
- The nervous system remains activated due to unresolved authorship confusion.

## Effective Regulatory Stance Identified

- Adoption of a non-intervention posture (“waiting”)
- Explicit recognition that the attentional shift occurred before choice
- Refusal to engage in corrective or suppressive responses
- Allowing attentional processes to resolve without attribution or control

This stance reduces distress by removing agency from involuntary processes, not by increasing control.

## Clinical Interpretation

This presentation is consistent with:

- Trauma-related attentional hypervigilance
- Shame-linked agency contamination
- Pre-conscious process misattribution

It is not indicative of cognitive weakness, loss of control, or impaired insight. On the contrary, the individual demonstrates unusually refined metacognitive awareness of attentional mechanics.

## Treatment Implications

- Emphasis on distinguishing volition vs. salience-driven attention
- Reinforcement of non-authorship of pre-conscious processes
- Avoidance of strategies aimed at attentional suppression
- Continued practice of non-interference and post-capture neutrality

## Summary

The individual is not destabilized by attentional capture itself, but by a conditioned belief that involuntary attention equals failure of agency. Correcting this attribution — rather than controlling attention — is central to regulation.

If you want, next we can:

- map this directly to CPTSD + OCD attentional loops
- contrast it with classic intrusive thought models (and why those don’t fully explain this)
- create a short “field note” version for quick reference when this shows up in real time
