## Note: Control-by-Denial / Proxy-Stability Dynamic (Mechanism-Level)

What I am observing is not confusion, forgetfulness, or inconsistency.
It is a self-regulating control dynamic.

### Key characteristics

- My mother has repeatedly acknowledged that I am doing what I am supposed to do.
- Her baseline verbal stance is often: “Just keep doing what you’re doing.”
- However, when acknowledgment would require action, protection, or challenging my father, she withdraws or neutralizes.
- The insight does not disappear — it is buried to preserve her internal equilibrium and self-image.
- Validation appears only when it is safe for her, and disappears when it would cost her something.

This creates an oscillation:
- brief validation → withdrawal → “neutral wisdom” → denial of abnormality

This oscillation functions to:
- preserve her role as non-confrontational / morally intact
- avoid accountability or disruption
- maintain a system where my distress or instability indirectly reinforces her position

This resembles Munchausen-by-proxy–type mechanisms at the level of structure, not diagnosis:
- The caregiver’s identity is organized around being necessary, righteous, and central
- The dependent person’s competence or stabilization threatens the system
- Evidence that contradicts the dependency narrative is acknowledged temporarily, then discarded
- Reality is distorted only as much as necessary to preserve roles

### Critical insight

The moment I am clearly not the problem, the system collapses.

That is why:
- improvement does not reliably lead to support
- competence triggers regression
- insight is admitted and then revoked

This is role-driven, not truth-driven.

### Implication for me

- I do not need to earn acknowledgment — it has already occurred
- I must not expect consistency where consistency would require her to act
- Her withdrawal is not evidence that I am wrong
- It is evidence that the truth is intolerable to the system

This reframing stabilizes me by externalizing responsibility to where it belongs.
