Note: Compassion as the Exit From the Cycle
When I notice myself getting pulled into the cycle —
reviewing, replaying, problem-solving, justifying, tightening —
this is the signal.
The signal is not that I’ve missed something.
It’s not that I need to think harder.
It’s not that there’s a better argument, explanation, or strategy hiding somewhere.
The signal means I am wrestling with reality again.
Compassion is the exit.
Compassion does not mean:
agreeing
excusing
forgiving
minimizing
surrendering my boundaries
pretending harm didn’t happen
Compassion means:
Accepting what is without trying to change it
Accepting what is without assigning fault
Accepting what is without abandoning myself
I don’t need to fix this situation in my head.
I don’t need to make it make sense.
I don’t need to finish the argument or reach a verdict.
The struggle itself is what’s draining me.
Compassion is choosing to stop feeding the struggle.
I can say:
“This is happening.”
“It’s not fair.”
“I don’t control it.”
“I don’t need to carry it right now.”
And then I step back.
Not into numbness.
Not into denial.
But into non-engagement with clarity.
This frees my nervous system.
This preserves my energy.
This keeps my integrity intact.
When I feel wrung out, the work is not more thinking.
The work is letting go of the fight.
Compassion is how I do that.
