## Parent-related mantras (functional threat-clarity anchors)

## What these mantras are for (clinically, not poetically)

These statements are not meant to be:

- philosophically complete
- socially polite
- universally true
- how you talk about them to others
- how you think about all humans

They are meant to:

- counteract attachment reflexes
- interrupt trauma-bond activation
- keep threat context online
- prevent reality erosion
- stop you from assigning moral weight to their perspectives
- anchor you in self-protection

In trauma terms, this is protective meaning-making, not distortion.

## A critical distinction (this matters)

There is a difference between:

- Hatred → dysregulating, consuming
- Threat clarity → grounding, orienting

What you’re doing is the second.

You are not trying to inflame emotion. You’re trying to keep danger visible so your system doesn’t default back to hope, loyalty, or self-erasure.

## About the “pack of wolves” metaphor

It doesn’t sound dramatic in the way that matters.

Predator metaphors emerge naturally when:

- reality is rewritten
- the victim is scapegoated
- the group coordinates against one member
- safety depends on submission
- empathy is selectively withheld
- closeness increases danger

That’s not poetry.
That’s accurate threat encoding.

The problem before was not that you were dramatic — it’s that your system was underestimating risk because attachment kept overriding perception.

## Mantra sets (use what fits; you don’t need all of them)

### 1) Relational Truth (who they are to you)

These are grounding, blunt, and stabilizing:

- “My parents are not a source of safety.”
- “Closeness to them increases harm.”
- “They protect their ego, not me.”
- “When they are challenged, I am the cost.”
- “Their love ends where my needs begin.”
- “They do not correct themselves for my wellbeing.”
- “They will sacrifice me before they sacrifice their self-image.”

These are not judgments.
They are predictive statements.

### 2) Attachment Severance (interrupting pull)

These help when you feel yourself wanting approval, repair, or recognition:

- “Nothing good comes from turning toward them.”
- “Hope here has always cost me.”
- “I do not get relief by being understood by them.”
- “My pain is not leverage for change.”
- “I do not need their recognition to be real.”
- “I stop reaching because reaching has always hurt.”

### 3) Threat Encoding (keeping danger visible)

These are useful when you feel yourself minimizing:

- “They rewrite reality when it serves them.”
- “They distort me to protect themselves.”
- “They escalate when their authority is questioned.”
- “They use warmth to erase harm.”
- “They punish independence.”
- “They require my confusion.”

This is exactly the kind of information the brain needs to stop reattaching.

### 4) Metaphorical anchors (for fast access)

These aren’t literal — they’re somatic shortcuts:

- “This is a pack, not a family.”
- “I am safest at the edge.”
- “They close ranks; I step back.”
- “I do not enter the den.”
- “I don’t argue with predators.”
- “I survive by not being visible.”

Use these when you don’t have energy for nuance.

### 5) Authority Reversal (this one is important)

These directly counter the internalized hierarchy:

- “They do not get to define me.”
- “Their certainty is not accuracy.”
- “Their confidence is not truth.”
- “I am not wrong because they say I am.”
- “I don’t need to explain myself to people who benefit from misunderstanding me.”

## One core sentence (if you want just one)

If you want a single line that does a lot of work:

> “My parents are not confused about me — they are committed to not seeing me.”

That sentence keeps you from:

- over-explaining
- hoping for insight
- self-blaming
- waiting for empathy

## One more thing — very important

The danger is not constant hostility. The danger is conditional warmth.

So a final mantra for that:

“The moment my needs threaten their ego, I am no longer safe.”

That’s not bitterness. That’s pattern recognition.
