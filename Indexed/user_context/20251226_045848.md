Note: Why My Mother Appears to Care

My mother’s expressions of care are primarily role-based and self-regulatory, not need-based.

She acts caring when:
It aligns with her self-image as a “good, compassionate person”
It maintains household equilibrium
It avoids conflict or emotional discomfort
It does not require confronting my father or risking her own stability

She withdraws or disengages when:
My needs require sustained protection or advocacy
Caring would involve discomfort, confrontation, or moral cost
A clear choice must be made between my well-being and her emotional safety

This indicates that her care is conditional and situational, rooted in duty, identity, and avoidance — not in prioritizing my internal state or survival when it matters most.

Therefore:
Small gestures of warmth cannot be used as proof of love
Extreme situations are the accurate diagnostic moments
The absence of empathy under pressure reframes all lesser acts

This is not about malice. It is about capacity and priority.

Recognizing this protects me from forming attachments based on intermittent reassurance and prevents repeated injury caused by expecting support that cannot be reliably given.
