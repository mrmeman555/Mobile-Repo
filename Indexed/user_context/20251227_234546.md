## Current Goal & Strategic Framing (Anchor Note)

My goal right now is not to abandon my long-term plans for independence and self-directed revenue.

My goal is to protect and reinforce the foundation that makes those plans viable under unstable conditions.

Given my current constraints:
- an unpredictable living environment
- a non-trivial health load
- and the real risk of losing time autonomy

the correct strategy is sequencing, not retreat.

Focusing on:
- a Net+ certification sprint
- deepening mastery of Cursor as my execution backbone
- implementing my AI systems inside Cursor workflows

is not a detour from my projects — it is infrastructure work for them.

Cursor is the substrate through which my skills become:
- executable
- repeatable
- scalable
- and monetizable

Every hour spent here:
- increases optionality
- compresses future build time
- protects my health
- and preserves my ability to build revenue streams when conditions stabilize

This phase exists to buy leeway — time, flexibility, and resilience — so I can still create the 6–12 month runway I originally planned, even if circumstances tighten.

I am not giving up my goals.
I am protecting them.

Daily success is defined as:
Strengthening the foundation that makes my independence possible.

If I do that, the plan is still alive — and moving forward.
