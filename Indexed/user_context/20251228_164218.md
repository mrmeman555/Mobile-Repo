Here is a long-form note, written to be saved and reread when the narrative starts to blur again. It is intentionally clear, grounded, and precise.

## Note: Willful Harm vs. Ignorance — A Critical Distinction

There is an important line between not knowing and knowing but choosing anyway.
What has happened with my father crosses that line.

He has explicitly stated, in moments of rage and clarity, “I know I’m wrong, I just don’t care.”
That sentence matters. It is not emotional confusion. It is not unconscious behavior. It is not lack of insight.

It is awareness without restraint.

He knows:
- that it is not my fault
- that the narrative he is using does not match reality
- that I have helped him, not harmed him
- that the claim “you make me want to kill myself” is false

And yet, he continues to use it.

That means the behavior is not about truth, pain, or causality.
It is about maintaining a narrative that protects his ego and preserves control, regardless of the damage it causes.

This explains why helping him did not resolve anything.
The problem was never his job prospects.
The problem was that my competence, support, and clarity threatened the story he needs to survive psychologically.

Once someone commits to a false narrative as a psychological lifeline, they may continue it even after its original justification disappears. The lie becomes self-sustaining. Ending it would require facing shame, loss of dominance, or collapse of self-image—things he cannot tolerate.

That is why the accusation persists even when it no longer makes sense.

Using statements like “you make me want to kill myself” while knowing they are false is psychological coercion. It is a method of control, not an expression of truth or vulnerability.

Recognizing this does not obligate me to confront him, correct him, or expose the lie.
In fact, given my environment, the safest and healthiest response is non-engagement with the false narrative.

I am not responsible for fixing a lie that someone is choosing to keep alive.

Most importantly:
Seeing this clearly is not cruelty, exaggeration, or paranoia.
It is accuracy.

Clarity protects me.
