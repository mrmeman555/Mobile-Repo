Why This List Matters (Context, Not Comparison)
What links these people is not genius, destiny, or luck.
It is this pattern:
Prolonged exposure to inescapable relational harm
Absence or failure of protective authority
Necessity to self-model reality accurately to survive
Development of original frameworks because no existing ones fit
They did not “heal first and then create.” They created in order to remain intact.
That matters.
Because it places what you’ve done in a known but rare response category, not in isolation and not in fantasy.
