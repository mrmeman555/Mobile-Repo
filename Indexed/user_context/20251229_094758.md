## Intent-Rewriting as Epistemic Abuse

### Core Concept

Intent-rewriting is a form of psychological and epistemic abuse in which a person’s stated motives, values, or good-faith efforts are systematically redefined by others as selfish, manipulative, hostile, or defective—regardless of evidence or consistency of behavior. The target is denied authority over their own inner experience.

This is not ordinary disagreement about behavior. It is an attack on the right to know one’s own mind.

## Why Intent-Rewriting Is Uniquely Damaging

### 1. Intent is the anchor of selfhood

Intent is how a person maintains continuity of identity: why they act, not just what they do. When intent is repeatedly invalidated or inverted, the self loses its primary reference point.

The message received is not:

“You made a mistake.”

But:

“You are fundamentally mistaken about who you are and why you act.”

This fractures identity at a foundational level.

---

### 2. It creates an unwinnable system

If intentions are always reinterpreted negatively, improvement becomes impossible. Good behavior does not lead to safety; it leads to further scrutiny. Effort itself becomes evidence of guilt.

This produces a correct, learned conclusion:

There is no action that leads to repair or trust.

This is not helplessness—it is an accurate appraisal of an abusive system.

### 3. Internalization and somatic fallout

Over time, the mind adapts by turning inward:

- Doubting one’s own motives
- Scanning for hidden badness
- Feeling contaminated during neutral or positive states

These are not cognitive errors. They are conditioned survival responses to repeated epistemic invalidation.

Somatically, this appears as:

- Sudden feelings of “wrongness”
- Flashback-like shifts in reality
- A sense that safety or goodness can be revoked at any moment

---

### 4. Link to intrusive memories and reality-shifts

The nervous system stores moments where sincere intent was punished or inverted. Later, when agency, confidence, or rest appears, the body reacts as if intent will again be weaponized.

These reactions occur without external triggers because the trigger is internal self-expression itself.

---

## Distinction from Ordinary Criticism

Criticism targets behavior.

Intent-rewriting targets identity.

A person can recover from being wrong. A person is destabilized when told they never knew themselves.

---

## Power Dynamics

Intent-rewriting is maintained because acknowledging the target’s good faith would collapse the abuser’s narrative and control. It is a dominance strategy, not a misunderstanding.

The function is to:

- Preserve moral superiority
- Justify ongoing control
- Avoid accountability

---

## Long-Term Effects

- Chronic self-doubt despite high competence
- Fear of rest or confidence
- Hypervigilance around self-expression
- Difficulty trusting internal signals

These effects persist until the individual reclaims authorship over their intentions.

---

## Recovery Axis

Healing requires:

- Explicit recognition that intent-rewriting occurred
- Reassertion of internal authority (“I know why I did this”)
- Externalizing blame to the system, not the self

Each act of naming intent accurately repairs the original injury.

## Key Reframe

> The harm was not that intentions were imperfect.
> The harm was that intentions were denied.

Reclaiming intent is reclaiming selfhood.
