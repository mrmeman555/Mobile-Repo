# Note: YouTube Algorithm Research & Data-Driven Space Analysis

Date: 2026-01-08

Forward-looking PoE YouTube note that adds the algorithm + data layer: treat YouTube as an optimization system, build priors from public data before publishing, and use reverse-engineering to identify demand>supply windows and MVP constraints.


---

## Purpose

This note formalizes algorithm research and data sourcing as a first-class component of the YouTube pipeline.

The objective is not intuition-based content creation, but asymmetric advantage:

- understanding how YouTube currently allocates attention
- identifying where demand exceeds supply
- exploiting existing data before most creators realize it exists


---

## 1) Algorithm research as a separate track

YouTube is not just a platform; it is an optimization system.

Before building an MVP, understand:

- what the algorithm currently rewards
- how those rewards differ by niche
- how creators unintentionally train it through behavior

Key algorithm dimensions to research:

- click-through rate (CTR)
- average view duration (AVD)
- retention curves (especially first 30–60 seconds)
- session time contribution
- viewer satisfaction signals (comments, likes, rewatches)
- consistency and topical coherence

This research informs how content should be structured, not just what content should be made.


---

## 2) Algorithm-focused research questions

Empirical questions to answer via research:

- What video lengths currently perform best in gaming / ARPG spaces?
- How does patch-driven content behave vs evergreen content?
- How quickly do videos decay after release?
- What framing styles reliably win clicks (fear, dominance, clarity, authority)?
- How often do new channels break through in niche spaces?


---

## 3) Identifying data sources (concrete inputs)

There is substantial publicly available data that can be leveraged without publishing a single video.

Primary data sources:

- YouTube search results (ranking patterns)
- channel analytics visible via SocialBlade
- view/subscriber ratios over time
- comment sections (what people ask repeatedly)
- video release timing vs view velocity
- patch notes, dev blogs, forums, Reddit, Discords
- existing PoE / PoE2 content archives
- creator tool discussions (e.g., retention breakdowns shared publicly)

Secondary sources:

- YouTube Creator Insider
- public case studies from creators
- algorithm experiments documented by others
- SEO tools (keyword volume, search intent proxies)

This is enough to build a strong prior before creating anything.

## 4) Data-driven space hunger hypothesis (PoE / PoE2)

Hypothesis worth explicitly logging:

- PoE2 is data-rich but insight-poor right now
- the number of creators is limited
- the audience is technically sophisticated and hungry for clarity
- most creators rely on gameplay access rather than analysis
- there is a lag between raw information and structured understanding

This creates a window where:

- synthesis > access
- analysis > novelty
- systems thinking > surface-level commentary

Critical implication:

> You do not need game access to produce high-value content if operating at the level of abstraction, modeling, and explanation.


---

## 5) Content without direct game access (strategic advantage)

Possible content types enabled by existing data:

- system breakdowns
- economy modeling
- design analysis
- patch implication forecasting
- meta-level comparisons
- player psychology & optimization behavior
- “what this change really means” content

These often outperform raw gameplay because they:

- reduce uncertainty
- save time
- elevate the viewer’s competence


---

## 6) Integrating algorithm research into the pipeline

Algorithm research feeds directly into:

- MVP definition
- video format constraints
- time investment decisions
- scaling decisions if traction appears

This implies:

- no fixed content plan
- no rigid commitment
- no premature identity lock-in

Instead: observe → infer → test → adapt.


---

## 7) Output of this phase

After completing this research layer, you should be able to:

- articulate how YouTube is likely to treat content before publishing
- identify low-competition, high-demand angles
- design an MVP that satisfies both audience and algorithm constraints
- decide whether scaling effort is justified

This aligns with confidence-based action and optionality.


---

## Meta-conclusion

This is not entering YouTube as a creator guessing for attention.

It is approaching YouTube as:

- a system to be reverse-engineered
- a market to be surveyed
- an opportunity to dominate through understanding

When ready, the next step is turning this into:

- a single deep research prompt, or
- a multi-stage automated analysis workflow

For now, this locks the frame.
