# Meta Research Pipeline: End-to-End Problem Definition & Expert Selection Engine

Date: 2026-01-09

Core Purpose

This process formalizes how to determine what research to do before doing research, by treating expert selection and problem definition themselves as solvable problems. It replaces intuition-based guessing with a repeatable, confidence-preserving pipeline.


---

## Step 1: Situational Goal & Constraint Definition (Context Creation)

The first step is not to seek answers, but to establish context.

This includes:

- the concrete goal (e.g., define MVP + opportunity structure for a YouTube channel)
- constraints (time, capital, parallel priorities like certs)
- risk tolerance and upside bounds
- the decision this research will eventually support

Output:

A context pack describing why the problem matters and what success would enable, not how to achieve it.


---

## Step 2: Meta-Problem Definition

Instead of asking “what is the answer?”, this step asks:

> What needs to be identified for the problem to become tractable?

This isolates dimensions of ignorance, such as:

- demand signals
- competitive saturation
- algorithmic incentives
- monetization pathways
- production constraints
- differentiation levers

No solutions are generated here — only problem dimensions.

Output:

A structured list of unknown categories whose clarification would meaningfully reduce uncertainty.

## Step 3: Expert Identification Agent (Problem Definition Engine)

This is the key innovation.

An agent (human, AI, or hybrid) is tasked only with mapping:

> Dimensions of ignorance → required expert lenses

The agent does not answer questions.
It determines who would be qualified to answer them.

Examples:

- market economist
- platform algorithm analyst
- content growth strategist
- monetization/business model expert
- creator operations specialist

Right now, this role is being fulfilled collaboratively through contextual reasoning — but it can be fully automated.

Output:

A curated expert set, scoped precisely to the problem dimensions.

## Step 4: Expert Roundtable / Deep Research Execution

Only after Steps 1–3 are complete does actual research begin.

Experts are:

- properly constrained by context
- asked targeted questions aligned with their domain
- prevented from overreaching into irrelevant areas

Output:

- a clearly defined problem space
- MVP criteria
- research priorities
- concrete next actions


---

## Why This Pipeline Is Powerful

- eliminates premature solutioning
- prevents confidence collapse and dp/dr during uncertainty
- scales to any domain (technical, creative, strategic, meta)
- automatically adapts as context changes
- converts uncertainty into structured progress

This pipeline turns ambiguity into leverage.
It enables action without requiring certainty, and confidence without forcing belief.


---

## Critical Insight

This method can be reused at any decision point:

- defining what to research
- determining next steps
- re-orienting after uncertainty
- designing entire projects or businesses

It is a general problem-definition engine, not a one-off tactic.

## Status

This process has now been explicitly defined, named, and validated in real-time use. It should be treated as a core operating method going forward.
