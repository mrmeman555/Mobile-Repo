# Note: Framework for Assessing the YouTube Space (Discovery & Analysis Phase)

Date: 2026-01-08

Methodological artifact for the PoE project: what to log/observe/analyze before committing to a YouTube MVP. This is a data-gathering and pattern-extraction phase, not a creative one.

## Purpose of This Note

This note defines what must be logged, observed, and analyzed before committing to a YouTube MVP.

The goal is not ideation yet — it is situational awareness: understanding the landscape, the value mechanics, and the algorithmic incentives that already exist.

This is a data-gathering and pattern-extraction phase, not a creative one.

## 1) Content Space Decomposition (What Exists)

### A) Niches (Macro-Level)

Log and categorize existing niches relevant to:

- PoE / ARPGs
- gaming optimization & systems thinking
- meta-analysis (builds, economies, patch dynamics)
- educational / explanatory content
- personality-driven commentary
- AI-assisted gaming or analysis
- hybrid niches (e.g., gaming × psychology × systems)

For each niche, log:

- size (rough proxy via top channels’ subscriber counts)
- saturation level (many similar channels vs few dominant ones)
- rate of content churn (daily vs weekly vs event-driven)


### B) Sub-Niches (Micro-Level)

Within each niche, isolate:

- specific recurring content formats (e.g., “league start guides”, “mistakes to avoid”, “why X is broken”, “hidden mechanics”)
- repeated framing patterns
- topics that resurface every patch / season / update

These are algorithmically reinforced patterns, not accidents.

## 2) Value Angles (Why People Watch)

For each channel or video cluster, identify the primary value proposition.

Common angles to log:

- speed — “fastest”, “quickest”, “TL;DR”
- authority — deep expertise, math, credibility
- novelty — unconventional builds, contrarian takes
- reduction of uncertainty — “what to do”, “what not to do”
- status signaling — mastery, dominance, elite play
- emotional regulation — reassurance, confidence, calm
- entertainment — humor, personality, storytelling

Note:

- most successful channels combine 2–3 angles, not one
- one angle is usually dominant


---

## 3) Channel-Level Analysis (Who Is Winning and Why)

For each reference channel, log:

- subscriber count
- upload frequency
- video length distribution
- title style (questions, assertions, dominance language, fear framing)
- thumbnail patterns (faces, arrows, numbers, minimalism)
- comment tone (confused, grateful, deferential, argumentative)

Log what they repeat, not what they say once.

Repetition = algorithmic reinforcement.

## 4) Monetization Structures (How Value Converts to Money)

Track monetization methods used:

- ad revenue only
- sponsorships
- affiliate links
- Patreon / memberships
- courses / guides
- coaching / consulting
- off-platform funnels (Discords, websites, email lists)

Key question:

> What behavior does the content condition the viewer to take next?

This reveals the economic intent of the channel.


---

## 5) Algorithm-Aware Framing (How the System Decides)

Log observations related to the YouTube algorithm:

- which videos spike vs plateau
- event-driven traffic (patches, leagues, updates)
- evergreen vs time-sensitive content
- long-tail performance vs burst performance

Consider:

- retention mechanics (hooks, pacing, structure)
- click-through optimization (titles/thumbnails)
- consistency signals (topic coherence over time)

The algorithm rewards:

- predictability of value
- audience satisfaction loops
- clear audience identity


---

## 6) Cross-Channel Pattern Extraction (The Real Goal)

After collecting examples:

- identify common constraints (what everyone must do)
- identify uncontested spaces (what no one is doing well)
- identify fragile dominance (channels winning by momentum, not depth)

This is where opportunity emerges.


---

## 7) Output of This Phase (What You’ll Have)

By the end of this analysis, you should be able to articulate:

- what types of content reliably succeed
- why they succeed
- where value is underserved
- how the algorithm currently “thinks”
- what an MVP must minimally satisfy to be viable
- what upper-bound trajectories look like if traction appears

Only after this does MVP design make sense.


---

## Meta-Note

This entire process is compatible with:

- deep research methodology
- iterative refinement
- algorithm-first thinking
- flexible prioritization between certs and content
- confidence-based action rather than certainty-seeking

You are not guessing.
You are surveying terrain before building infrastructure.

When ready, the next step will be:

> turning this framework into a concrete research prompt or pipeline.

For now, this note is the anchor.
