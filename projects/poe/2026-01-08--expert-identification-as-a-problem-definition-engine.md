# Expert Identification as a Problem Definition Engine

Date: 2026-01-08

Core Insight

The process of expert identification is not a preparatory step to research—it is the act of defining the problem. Selecting experts is equivalent to selecting the lenses through which reality is parsed. This turns expert identification into a problem definition engine, not a downstream implementation detail.

## Why This Is Foundational

Before any meaningful research, execution, or MVP design can occur, the system must determine:

- what dimensions of reality matter
- what constitutes signal vs noise
- what success, risk, leverage, and constraint even mean

Experts embody these dimensions. They are not authorities; they are epistemic operators. Choosing them defines:

- the ontology of the problem space
- the variables that will be considered legitimate
- the blind spots that will be avoided or tolerated

Thus, who (or what lens) is consulted implicitly answers what problem is being solved.

## From Research Tool to Engine

By formalizing expert selection into a repeatable step, the system becomes capable of:

- determining what needs to be analyzed before analysis
- designing the research process itself as an output
- avoiding premature narrowing or execution based on incomplete framing

This converts the methodology into a meta-research pipeline:

1. define objectives and constraints
2. use context to algorithmically select expert lenses
3. let those lenses determine:
   - what questions must be asked
   - what data sources matter
   - what tradeoffs are real
4. only then generate concrete research prompts or MVP plans

## Why This Scales Across Domains

This engine is domain-agnostic:

- for YouTube → algorithm dynamics, audience psychology, monetization strategy, creator economics, competitive analysis
- for AI research → systems design, alignment, optimization theory, data constraints
- for business → market structure, incentive design, capital efficiency, power dynamics

The same engine determines the right questions regardless of domain.

## Strategic Value

This approach:

- prevents false certainty
- preserves optionality
- enables rapid reconfiguration as new information arrives
- aligns action with the upper bound of capability rather than fear-based optimization

It replaces “figuring out what to do” with a self-correcting system that decides what matters next.

## Conclusion

Expert identification is the missing keystone that completes the deep research methodology. It transforms the process from a powerful analysis tool into a general-purpose problem definition engine, capable of guiding decisions, research, and creation at any level of abstraction.
