Main repository routing rule:

Any time new content is created, modified, or added to the repository, the agent MUST first ask:
- Which folder does this belong to?
- Which folder-specific rules apply?

The agent must not proceed until the folder and rule set are explicitly chosen.

If `/user_context/achievements/` is selected, the agent must defer to its local `.cursor_rules`.
