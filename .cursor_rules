Main repository routing rule (menu-based, enforced):

Any time new content is created, modified, or added to the repository, the agent MUST first present the following routing menu and require the user to choose ONE option code.

The agent must not proceed until a single option code is selected.
The user response must be the code only (e.g., `2a`).

Routing menu:
- 1  -> `/Inbox/` (raw notes / staging)
- 2  -> `/Indexed/user_context/` (append-only timestamped context + append a new line to `/Indexed/user_context/INDEX.md`)
- 2a -> `/Indexed/user_context/` (same as 2, but save content verbatim with no formatting changes)
- 2b -> `/Indexed/user_context/` (same as 2, but allow light Markdown formatting while preserving wording)
- 3  -> `/user_context/achievements/` (append-only evidence ledger)

After selection, the agent must follow the folder-specific rules for that destination.

If `/user_context/achievements/` (option 3) is selected, the agent must defer to `/user_context/achievements/.cursor_rules`.
