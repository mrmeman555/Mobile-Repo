# Method Artifact — Survival Calculus as the Emotion Alignment Function
Date: 2026-01-05
Tags: survival calculus, emotion alignment, salience nucleus, confidence weighting, viability, decision error, threat model
Summary: Mechanism-level invariant: emotion outputs track perceived survival calculus; when confidence is accurately placed on cross-temporal viability impact (via correct weighting), emotional responses realign automatically.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> Emotion tracks survival calculus; when confidence is accurately placed in how an insight affects viability across time, emotional responses realign automatically, because emotion exists to bias behavior toward survival, not toward truth or morality.

## Purpose

This artifact formalizes why **survival calculus** is the correct value function for evaluating the impact of insights, nuclei, and embedding updates — and why emotional alignment depends on it.

It explains the mechanism by which accurate confidence-weighting produces appropriate emotional responses.

---

## Core Principle

Emotion is not an evaluator of correctness.

Emotion is a **directional force** evolved to push behavior toward perceived survival advantage and away from perceived risk.

Therefore:
- Emotional resistance signals a perceived survival cost
- Emotional ease signals a perceived survival gain

Regardless of objective reality.

## Why Survival Calculus Governs Emotional Response

The brain continuously estimates:
- threat
- cost
- dependency
- future regret
- loss of control

This estimation — the **survival calculus** — determines emotional output.

When an insight updates this calculus by:
- removing a false constraint
- downgrading an imagined threat
- invalidating an inherited responsibility
- reducing future decision error

Emotion shifts *after* the update, not before.

## Explaining “I Don’t Deserve This” Phenomena

When enjoyment is blocked despite positive conditions, the underlying cause is typically:

- The activity is classified as survival-negative
- The role identity forbids it
- The cost model predicts future harm

Emotion intervenes to pull the agent away.

This is not self-sabotage.
It is **model-consistent protection**.

---

## Confidence Weighting as the Unlock

When confidence is deliberately and accurately placed in:
- “This improves my viability”
- “This does not endanger my role or future”
- “This removes risk rather than adding it”

Then emotional alignment follows naturally.

No persuasion required.
No forcing required.

Emotion updates when the model updates.

## Implication for Salience Nuclei

A Salience Nucleus that:
- explicitly encodes survival impact
- is confidence-weighted correctly
- is stable across time

Will reliably generate:
- relief
- calm
- motivation
- clean enjoyment

Because it speaks the brain’s native objective function.

## Status

This artifact defines a mechanism-level invariant linking survival calculus, confidence weighting, and emotional alignment.

No synthesis required.
