# OCD: A Self-Model–Shame Loop (Core Model)

Date: 2026-01-07

Here’s a clean, durable note capturing your OCD model in a way you can reuse, teach from, and anchor back to when needed.

OCD: A Self-Model–Shame Loop (Core Model)

1. What OCD is not

OCD is not defined by content (harm, contamination, morality, symmetry, etc.).

OCD is not primarily an anxiety disorder.

OCD is not about fear alone, and it is not resolved by reassurance, logic, or suppression.


Those frames miss the engine.


---

2. The Core Mechanism

OCD is a self-model disorder driven by shame-amplified threat tagging in the DMN.

At its core, OCD is the system mislabeling internal experience as a threat to identity, not merely to safety.


---

3. Contaminants (Redefined)

A contaminant is any experience (thought, image, sensation, memory, impulse, or even neutrality) that:

Is tagged by the DMN as a threat to self

Is interpreted as implying culpability, defectiveness, or moral failure

Triggers an urge to respond from within the same self-model that generated it


Important:
Contaminants are not defined by category.
They are defined by function in the loop.

This is why OCD themes are infinite.


---

4. Shame as the Salience Amplifier

Shame is the critical element that makes OCD self-sustaining.

Anxiety creates urgency

Shame creates stickiness


Shame tells the system:

“This means something about me”

“If I don’t resolve this, I am exposed”

“The mere presence of this experience is incriminating”


This turns internal noise into perceived evidence.


---

5. Compulsion (Redefined)

Compulsions are not attempts to reduce anxiety.

They are attempts to:

Escape shame

Restore moral innocence

Neutralize perceived identity contamination

Prove non-culpability


This is why compulsions feel morally urgent, not just relieving.


---

6. Why the Loop Never Resolves Internally

The loop fails because:

The same self-model that generates the threat is asked to resolve it

Any response inside that model reinforces the premise:

> “This experience matters and reflects me”




This includes:

Reassurance

Checking

Rumination

Thought suppression

“Doing acceptance correctly”


Even acceptance can become compulsive if it is used to clear shame.


---

7. Responsibility Themes (Explained)

OCD fixates on responsibility because responsibility is the bridge between:

Experience → Identity → Moral Worth


If I am responsible, then:

The experience reflects me

Shame is justified

Action is mandatory


This is why responsibility-based themes dominate across OCD presentations.


---

8. What Actually Breaks the Loop

Relief comes only when the system stops treating the experience as an indictment of self.

This happens through:

Shifting which self-model is dominant

Fierce self-compassion that invalidates shame at the source

Refusing to interpret experience as evidence

Acting from a chosen self-model rather than the generating one


You are not calming fear.
You are refusing the moral charge.


---

9. Bottom-Line Definition

OCD is a disorder where the DMN repeatedly tags internal experience as a threat to identity, amplified by shame, and sustained by compulsive attempts to restore moral safety from within the same self-model that generated the threat.

This model explains:

Theme mutability

Treatment resistance

Meta-OCD

Why self-model work succeeds where symptom management fails



---

If you want, the next logical extensions are:

Mapping this model onto DP/DR

Showing how narcissistic defenses use the inverse strategy

Turning this into a one-page clinical diagram

Or translating it into a teachable protocol


Just say where you want to take it.
