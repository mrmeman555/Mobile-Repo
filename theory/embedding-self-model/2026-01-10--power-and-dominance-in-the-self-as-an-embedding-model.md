Summary: Defines power/dominance as control primitives inside the embedding-self model (salience, epistemic authority, policy enforcement, boundaries, memory access); frames DP/DR as loss of interpretive/policy control to a coercive scapegoating model; argues reconsolidation requires compassionate dominance (authority held under affective load) to update meaning and restore pull motivation.

## 1) Definitions in embedding terms

### The self as an embedding

The “self” is a high-dimensional embedding that:

- encodes identity-beliefs (“what I am”)
- encodes causal models (“what causes what”)
- encodes value/priorities (“what matters”)
- assigns salience weights to memories, interpretations, and action policies
- selects which “self-model” is dominant in the moment (healthy vs scapegoating, etc.)

Experience is the output of inference inside the currently dominant self-model.

### Power (embedding definition)

Power = capacity to move reality (internal or external) toward a chosen outcome.

In embedding terms, power is:

- the ability to change salience
- the ability to choose an interpretation and keep it
- the ability to select actions despite affective resistance
- the ability to impose a policy (a plan) on the system

Power is not morality. It is control bandwidth.

### Dominance (embedding definition)

Dominance = successful priority enforcement under resistance.

Dominance is what power looks like when there’s competition:

- competition between self-models
- competition between interpretations
- competition between action policies
- competition between social agents (other humans)

Dominance is not “being mean.” Dominance is which model wins.

## 2) What power is composed of (mechanistic components)

Power isn’t one thing — it’s a stack of capabilities that together determine “how dangerous you are” (dangerousness = capacity to dominate).

### A) Epistemic authority

Who gets to decide what is true?

- scapegoating self-model claims authority via shame, dread, coercion
- healthy self-model claims authority via evidence integration + values alignment

Power requires the ability to say:

> “My interpretation is the arbitrator of meaning, not the coercive model.”

This is epistemic dominance.

### B) Salience control

Salience is the currency of the self-embedding. Whichever model controls salience controls experience.

Power includes:

- selecting which cues enter working memory
- tagging contextual facts as “load-bearing”
- down-weighting irrelevant threat signals
- refusing to amplify shame narratives

Dominance is when you do this while the system is trying to pull you elsewhere.

### C) Policy enforcement (action selection)

If the brain is a policy engine, then power is:

- the ability to execute a policy even when affect says “don’t”
- the ability to persist long enough for prediction error to accumulate
- the ability to stop compulsive policies from running

Dominance is when:

> values-based policy overrides threat-based policy.

### D) Boundary setting (constraint imposition)

Boundaries are external dominance. Internally, boundaries are also a constraint:

- “That interpretation is not admissible.”
- “That compulsion is not being executed.”
- “That person’s narrative is not authoritative.”

Healthy dominance is the ability to limit what can influence you.

### E) Memory access and retrieval control

The dominant self-model controls what you can remember easily.

When scapegoating dominates:

- strengths become inaccessible
- competence becomes unreal
- future becomes hopeless
- you “can’t think”

Power includes restoring access by:

- reactivating the healthy model
- reasserting contextual truth
- reweighting the embedding so competence becomes cheap-to-retrieve again

## 3) Why power is inseparable from DP/DR

In this model, DP/DR is what it feels like when:

- the scapegoating model dominates
- the healthy model is suppressed
- salience is skewed toward threat / moral wrongness
- agency is reduced

DP/DR is essentially:

> “Loss of interpretive and policy control.”

So the antidote isn’t comfort. It’s restoring dominance of the healthy model.

That’s why defiance works: it is the felt experience of reasserting authority.


---

## 4) Two forms of dominance: shame-dominance vs compassionate dominance

### Shame-dominance (coercive)

Goal: stabilize self-image via certainty. Mechanism:

- “Prove I’m good/special by condemning something.”
- project shame outward or inward
- reduce uncertainty by collapsing possibility into guilt/blame

Outputs:

- compulsions
- anger-as-control
- narcissistic dynamics
- moral scrupulosity
- scapegoating self

This is dominance driven by attribution.

### Compassionate dominance (fierce self-compassion)

Goal: stabilize agency and reduce suffering. Mechanism:

- refuse shame-attribution as epistemic authority
- protect self/others via boundaries and truth-assertion
- accept imperfection without collapse
- enforce values-based policy over coercive policy

Outputs:

- stable self access
- lower DP/DR
- reduced compulsions
- increased motivation
- improved learning and integration

This is dominance driven by non-attribution + values enforcement.

Key point:

> Compassion does not remove dominance. Compassion governs dominance.

## 5) Why effective reconsolidation requires power and dominance

Memory reconsolidation requires:

1. reactivation of a salient memory/state
2. introduction of new information or meaning while memory is labile
3. holding long enough for the system to update

The problem:

Reactivating the memory triggers the scapegoating model, which tries to regain dominance via:

- shame spikes
- urgency
- “this is dangerous”
- compulsive checking
- derealization/flatness
- “this will never end”

Reconsolidation only works if you can:

- keep the memory online without conceding authority
- keep the new meaning online without collapsing
- refuse the compulsion to “fix the feeling” via shame-control

That is dominance.

So reconsolidation is literally:

> Dominating the meaning layer long enough to update the embedding.

## 6) The role of “chosen perspective” as dominance

Chosen perspective is not “positive thinking.” It is selection of the governing prior.

Mechanically:

- “chosen perspective” = the healthy model’s interpretation policy
- holding it = dominance against competing priors
- repetition = embedding shift (weights update)

When you choose the healthy model while fear is active, you generate:

- prediction error for the old model
- reinforcement for the new model

The “defiance” feeling is:

> the conscious marker of epistemic dominance being restored.

## 7) What “accepting power” means in practice

Acceptance here doesn’t mean “enjoying being above people.” It means accepting these truths:

1) You will dominate something.

Either you dominate your own meaning-making…
Or your shame system dominates you.

2) Avoiding dominance is not neutral.

It usually means surrendering power to coercive models.

3) Truth requires authority.

If you refuse authority, lies win by default (because they’re louder).

4) Boundaries are dominance.

Refusing access, refusing narratives, refusing coercion.

5) Compassion requires force.

Not force as harm.
Force as refusal to allow harm to govern reality.


---

## 8) Why enjoying power can be healthy (in this case)

Enjoying domination used to trigger “evil” panic; that was a conditioned shame association.

Refusing to enjoy power kept agency shame-locked.

Allowing the felt experience of power:

- restores access to a forbidden capability
- provides nervous-system proof: “agency is safe”
- updates the association: power ≠ evil; power + compassion = protection

This is reclaiming a control primitive that was shame-locked.

## 9) Dominance and the “scapegoating self” loop

Scapegoating (internal or external) is dominance-by-condemnation.

The scapegoating self tries to dominate by:

- declaring you unsafe
- declaring you wrong
- making progress feel unreal
- making rest feel immoral
- making uncertainty feel fatal

So the method works by:

- recognizing scapegoating as a rival authority
- refusing its jurisdiction
- asserting the healthy model as sovereign

That sovereignty is dominance.


---

## 10) Practical protocol: compassionate dominance reconsolidation

1. Activate a memory/state that triggers the scapegoating model
2. Name the rival model: “this is scapegoating authority trying to run”
3. Claim authority: “I decide meaning here.”
4. Assert contextual truth (facts the scapegoater ignores)
5. Hold under load (allow affect, do not negotiate)
6. Enforce boundary against compulsive policies (checking, reassurance, retreat)
7. Seal with values-based conclusion (what this means about you / what you will do)
8. Stop (don’t over-review — that reopens the loop)

Repeat = embedding shift.


---

## 11) Bottom line

- power is the capacity to shape inference, salience, and action
- dominance is what power looks like when something resists (fear, shame, people, systems)
- DP/DR is the felt experience of losing dominance to a coercive self-model
- reconsolidation requires dominance because updating meaning under affective load requires holding authority
- compassion is the governing principle that prevents dominance from becoming abuse

Therefore:

- compassion without power becomes helplessness
- power without compassion becomes harm
- compassionate dominance is the mechanism of liberation
