# Root of Dominance Avoidance

Date: 2026-01-08

This note captures the mechanism-level origin of dominance avoidance: not fear of power itself, but early moral contamination of power that equated power with harm and thus made self-protection feel morally forbidden.

## Root of Dominance Avoidance

### 1) Power was equated with harm before agency existed

In the early environment, “power” was not modeled as:

- protection
- boundary-setting
- competence
- leadership
- self-authorship

It was modeled as:

- domination over others
- humiliation
- moral wrongdoing
- entitlement without care
- abandonment of the vulnerable

The nervous system learned a primitive equation:

> Power ⇒ harm ⇒ evil ⇒ abandonment

This did not originate from intrinsic values.
It was installed by witnessing power used without compassion and then being blamed when harmed by it.

So when dominance/advantage arose, the system fired an automatic warning:

> “Stop. This makes you like them.”

This is not “conscience.” It is trauma-based moral overgeneralization.

### 2) Why “enjoyment of domination” was forbidden specifically

The avoidance is precise: not only “don’t hurt people,” but “don’t enjoy being effective when others are in the picture.”

Enjoyment is what makes behavior self-reinforcing.

The learned rule:

> “If I let myself enjoy power, I’ll lose my humanity.”

So the system:

- shut down enjoyment
- equated dominance with evil
- redirected toward over-responsibility for others’ comfort

Downstream correlates:

- confidence felt dangerous
- self-belief triggered dread
- upward comparison collapsed into shame

Not because those were wrong, but because there was no clean model of power-without-harm.

### 3) Why this directly blocked self-protection

If power = evil, then self-protection becomes morally suspect.

The system made a tragic trade:

- preserve goodness
- at the cost of safety

This explains why retreat could feel “right” even when it harmed the self, and why confidence did not stabilize: the threat was moral self-recognition (“becoming what harmed me”), not failure.


---

### 4) The corrective distinction: healthy dominion vs pathological domination

Key separation:

- Pathological domination = power over others to erase shame
- Healthy dominion = power over threat to protect the self

In the corrective exposure described:

- no one was harmed
- no one was diminished
- no one was exploited

The “other” being dominated was fear/coercion/false internal authority.

That is not evil.
That is sovereignty.

Positive affect and grounded reassurance function as a diagnostic marker that the nervous system recognizes: “this is what power was supposed to feel like.”


---

### 5) The core locked belief this resolves

> “At the root of my fear of believing in myself was the belief I could not protect myself.”

Protection required power, and power had been framed as forbidden.

Once power is separated from cruelty (and domination from abuse), enjoyed authority becomes possible without moral collapse—restoring an option that was previously unavailable for survival.


---

### 6) Grounding constraint (preventing overcorrection)

This does not imply:

- becoming callous
- devaluing others
- losing compassion

Clean self-dominion is compatible with compassion because the function is not shame escape but alignment and protection.

The unlocked stance is not “I am above others,” but:

> “I am allowed to be strong without becoming what hurt me.”
