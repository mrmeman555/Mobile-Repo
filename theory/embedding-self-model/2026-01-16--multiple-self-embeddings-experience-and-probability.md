Summary: Proposes that multiple coexisting self-models compete for dominance; whichever is dominant functions as a reference frame that reorganizes salience, threat, time, and possibility. Experience can be modeled as probabilistic inference over time, with shifts in dominant self-embedding changing the priors and thus the felt world.

---

It increasingly seems that the brain does not contain a single, unified “self,” but rather multiple self-models or self-embeddings that coexist, overlap, and compete for dominance.

These include (at least conceptually):

- a narrative self (the story of “me” across time),
- an embodied or minimal self (sensorimotor presence),
- a social/evaluative self (how I am seen and judged),
- a goal-directed agentic self (the doer, planner),
- and a meta or observing self (the one that notices the others).

Importantly, these are not just philosophical abstractions. Different self-models appear to correspond to different neural networks, integration patterns, and modes of processing.

What feels critical is this:

> Whichever self-model is dominant at a given moment fundamentally reorganizes experience itself.

This is not just a change in interpretation. It changes:

- what feels salient,
- what feels threatening or safe,
- how time is experienced,
- what futures feel possible,
- how the body feels,
- and even what “reality” seems to be.

The same brain, under different dominant self-embeddings, can feel like it is inhabiting entirely different worlds.

## Dominance is not truth — it is a reference frame

None of these self-models is necessarily “more true” than the others. Instead, each functions as a reference frame.

For example:

When the social/evaluative self dominates, experience compresses around threat, judgment, urgency, and comparison.

When the observing or embodied self dominates, experience often expands, time slows, and identity loosens.

When the narrative self dominates, everything is filtered through memory, anticipation, and story.

The dominant self-model doesn’t merely color experience — it determines what experience is available at all.

## Experience as probabilistic inference over time

This leads to a compelling way of understanding experience:

> Experience can be modeled as an ongoing inference process, shaped by prior models (beliefs, self-embeddings, expectations), incoming sensory data, and time.

In this sense, experience resembles a kind of continuous probability collapse:

- many interpretations are possible at any moment,
- one becomes “actual” based on priors and context,
- that “actuality” is continuously updated as time passes.

When a dominant self-model shifts, the priors shift — and suddenly:

- different sensations matter,
- different meanings arise,
- different actions feel natural,
- different futures feel plausible.

This helps explain why meditation, psychedelics, trauma, or insight can feel ontologically different, not just emotionally different.

## Why the space–time analogy fits

The analogy to space and time is not merely poetic — it is structurally informative.

Some parallels:

- Reference frames: just as physics has no absolute frame of reference, experience may have no single absolute “self,” only relative ones.
- Time dilation: subjective time expands or contracts depending on which self-model is dominant.
- Collapsed possibilities: many experiential possibilities exist, but one resolves into actuality based on priors and conditions.
- Continuity illusion: identity feels continuous even though it is reconstructed moment by moment.

From this perspective, the self is less like an object and more like a coordinate system.

Change the coordinates, and the same underlying reality feels fundamentally different.

## Practical implications

This model helps make sense of several phenomena:

- DP/DR as a shift in reference frame rather than a loss of reality,
- why exposure work involves allowing alternate self-models to exist without panic,
- why insight alone doesn’t “fix” things (insight changes the map, not which map is dominant),
- why motivation, peace, shame, and meaning are so dependent on frame dominance,
- why leaning into different perspectives can feel like becoming someone else.

Dominance is not established by understanding alone. It emerges through safety, repetition, practice, and reduced threat.

## Careful synthesis (held provisionally)

A useful way to hold this idea without overreach is:

> Human experience emerges from multiple self-models interacting over time. Whichever model is dominant functions as a reference frame that shapes perception, meaning, and the felt structure of reality. Experience unfolds as a probabilistic inference process constrained by priors and updated through time, much like a system resolving itself moment by moment.

This does not require metaphysical commitment, nor does it reduce experience to something trivial. It keeps the inquiry open while remaining grounded.

## Why this insight matters

Once it becomes clear that selfhood is plural and dynamic, a great deal of existential pressure loosens:

- failure no longer defines the whole,
- shame becomes one frame among many, not reality itself,
- possibility space reopens,
- and reality becomes navigable rather than fixed.

Life does not become easy — but it becomes workable.

This note is not a claim about ultimate truth.
It is a model — one that seems to organize lived experience, neuroscience, and phenomenology in a coherent way, and that remains open to revision.
