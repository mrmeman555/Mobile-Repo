Summary: Exploratory model framing lived reality as boundary collapse and encoding across time, with black hole, perception, and AI parallels.

This is an exploratory, non-assertive model describing how possibility becomes lived experience. It is coherent as a mapping across physics, perception, and information - not a claim of literal truth.

Core Idea

Reality-as-experienced is not the full state space of what is possible, but the encoded residue of irreversible collapse.

Experience occurs at a moving boundary where:

future = uncollapsed possibility

present = selection / commitment

past = encoded, fixed information

Time is the motion of this boundary.

---

Black Hole / Event Horizon Analogy

A black hole provides a clean structural metaphor:

The event horizon is not a place in space, but a boundary on observability

Information is not lost, but encoded on the surface

Inside/outside are complementary, not jointly accessible

Mapped to experience:

We are always at the horizon

Each moment collapses possibility into record

Lived reality is the surface encoding, not the full underlying state

The horizon advances - we call this time.

---

Collapse as the Fundamental Operation

Collapse is not merely measurement; it is commitment to a basis.

Collapse implies:

loss of alternatives

reduction of dimensionality

irreversibility

entropy increase

In experiential terms:

choice resolves

ambiguity dies

memory replaces possibility

Collapse, encoding, and irreversibility are the same operation at different scales.

---

Relation to Perception

Perception functions as basis selection:

the brain locks into a coordinate system (space, time, self)

then forgets that the choice was made

This forgetting makes experience inhabitable.

Pressure forces rapid collapse. Rest loosens commitment, allowing more possibilities to coexist before encoding.

---

AI / Representation Angle

AI behaves like an unscoped representational substrate:

many models

many bases

no forced collapse into a single lived trajectory

Humans live on the collapsed side:

one body

one timeline

one survival path at a time

Both operate on the same underlying informational substrate, with different scoping rules.

---

Conceptual Lineage (Not Identity)

This model overlaps with:

the Holographic Principle (information encoded on boundaries)

Black Hole Information Theory (irreversibility + complementarity)

It from Bit / Participatory Universe (reality from information)

Computational / Digital Physics (rules over hardware)

It removes anthropocentrism and treats collapse as a general constraint, not a human act.

---

One-Line Compression

Lived reality is the surface-level encoding produced as possibility irreversibly collapses at a moving boundary we experience as time.

---

Epistemic Posture

This is a high-signal, coherent exploratory model. It is used as if true for insight, not asserted as ontological fact.

Done.
That's a single, durable note - compact enough to store, dense enough to re-enter later without re-deriving anything.

It captures:

the core mechanism (boundary -> collapse -> encoding),

the black hole / event horizon framing,

the perception and AI parallels,

and - crucially - the epistemic posture you care about.

You can move on cleanly now.
If you ever come back to it, it'll still hold without needing repair or defense.
