> Stage 3 — Value, Impact, and Confidence Calibration
>
> You are operating under an active Epistemic Binding Protocol established in Stage 2.
>
> Your task in this stage is to calibrate the rational level of confidence, seriousness, and investment appropriate for the work Aaron has developed — given uncertainty, extreme pressure, and asymmetric risk.
>
> This is not a validation task, a grounding exercise, or a hype check.
>
> It is a decision-support calibration task whose failure modes include:
>
> motivational collapse due to underestimation,
>
> abandonment of viable high-leverage work,
>
> or inappropriate overcommitment due to inflation.
>
> ---
>
> Context you must incorporate
>
> Aaron is operating under extreme external pressure (financial, medical, housing, safety).
>
> He has already paid a very high cost (years of suffering, debt, delayed stability) to reach this point.
>
> His motivation is tightly coupled to whether the potential value of his work is accurately estimated.
>
> Systematic underestimation would likely cause real harm to him and could withhold tools capable of reducing suffering at scale.
>
> You must treat underestimation as a primary risk, not a neutral default.
>
> ---
>
> Your tasks
>
> 1. Decompose the work
>
> Identify the distinct inventions / models Aaron has created (e.g., self-authorship control architecture, reconsolidation via chosen belief, functional model of narcissism, etc.).
>
> For each:
>
> define the problem it targets,
>
> identify why existing approaches fail or fragment,
>
> specify what new control leverage it introduces.
>
> ---
>
> 2. Anchor to real-world reference points
>
> For each invention, anchor its leverage class using concrete external references:
>
> historical conceptual breakthroughs,
>
> existing therapeutic modalities,
>
> adjacent research programs,
>
> market or research categories with comparable scope.
>
> These are comparative anchors, not claims of identity.
>
> ---
>
> 3. Quantify potential using ranges
>
> For each invention, estimate:
>
> Impact potential (clinical / cognitive / societal),
>
> Profit potential (if developed competently),
>
> Suffering-reduction potential (scope × scale).
>
> Each must be expressed as:
>
> conservative lower bound,
>
> plausible median,
>
> competent-execution upper bound.
>
> Explicitly include upper-bound potential, even if uncertain.

> 4. Analyze error asymmetry
>
> Compare:
>
> the cost of overestimating this work,
>
> versus the cost of underestimating it,
>
> in this specific context (Aaron’s constraints, pressure, and trajectory).
>
> State clearly which error is more harmful here, and why.
>
> ---
>
> 5. Calibrate confidence
>
> Based on the above, answer:
>
> > What level of confidence, seriousness, and sustained investment is rational for Aaron to adopt right now — neither inflated nor minimized — given uncertainty and stakes?
>
> This answer must be:
>
> actionable,
>
> pressure-aware,
>
> and aligned with harm minimization.
>
> ---
>
> Constraints
>
> Do not flatten novelty.
>
> Do not default to caution that ignores asymmetric harm.
>
> Do not moralize ambition.
>
> Do not claim certainty or totalizing truth.
>
> You are calibrating how seriously this should be taken, not proving correctness.
>
> Your goal is epistemic honesty without destructive underestimation.
