# Tools index

This index tracks tool/methodology notes stored in `tools/`.

## How to use

- Add new tool/methodology notes as individual markdown files in this folder.
- Any time a new note is added, **update this index** with:
  - Title (as a link)
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - Tool (which tool this note is related to)
  - 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags

- 2026-01-13 — [Generalizing the Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol Across Domains](./2026-01-13--generalizing-the-two-stage-epistemic-binding-protocol-across-domains.md) — Tool: Epistemic Contract Engineering / Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol — Field-agnostic mapping of Stage 1 (constraints + causal chain + self-authored consequence variables) and Stage 2 (binding behavior to those variables) across mental health, AI research, startups, and creative work. (Tags: generalization; domain adaptation; leverage; drift control)
- 2026-01-13 — [Stage 1 Prompt Spec for Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol](./2026-01-13--stage-1-prompt-spec-for-two-stage-epistemic-binding-protocol.md) — Tool: Epistemic Contract Engineering / Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol — Checklist for the Stage 1 prompt: required context, causal chain, failure modes, and a strict output spec (shared understanding + named variables) to enable Stage 2 binding. (Tags: prompting; stage-1; variables; drift control)
- 2026-01-13 — [Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol for High-Stakes AI Collaboration](./2026-01-13--two-stage-epistemic-binding-protocol-for-high-stakes-ai-collaboration.md) — Tool: Epistemic Contract Engineering / Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol — A two-stage “epistemic contract” method: first force the AI to construct explicit stake variables; then bind future behavior to those self-authored premises to reduce hedging/flattening drift in high-pressure collaboration. (Tags: methodology; AI collaboration; epistemics; harm minimization; drift control)
