Summary: Canonical router for the CDRP bootstrap phase. Captures why CDRP exists, its relationship to the existing tools ecosystem and indexing rules, and defines the constraints and “done conditions” for staging a new single-purpose agent—without creating tool methodology/use-case artifacts yet.

## Scope of this file

This file is the **canonical coordination anchor** for bootstrapping the CFC Drift Recalibration Protocol (CDRP).

It is not post-hoc documentation. It is part of the tool’s control surface:

- a live build log / rationale ledger
- a context seed for instantiating a future single-purpose agent
- a rehydration mechanism if development spans sessions/agents

## Current phase: Bootstrap only (no methodology yet)

In this phase, we are **not** creating CDRP methodology files or use-case artifacts yet.

We are creating **context-transfer artifacts** that allow a new dedicated agent to start with:

- correct understanding
- correct constraints
- correct relationship to existing tools
- correct indexing semantics

## Relationship to existing tools

CDRP is intended to sit **in front of** the existing tool:

- **Epistemic Contract Engineering / Two-Stage Epistemic Binding Protocol** (plus Stage 3)

CDRP is the **drift recovery / mode reset** mechanism, especially for cases where the target assistant is **external** (e.g., ChatGPT interface) and therefore **cannot read this repo** directly.

## Key constraint (external execution target)

The target assistant for CDRP is expected to be outside Cursor and **without repo access**.

Therefore, CDRP must include an **export mechanism** (portable “alignment packet”) generated by the Cursor-side agent using repo-backed retrieval, then pasted/uploaded into the external assistant.

## Tools folder coordination rules (must be preserved)

CDRP must comply with the tools ecosystem rules:

- Canonical structure: `tools/<tool-slug>/methodology/` and `tools/<tool-slug>/use-cases/<use-case>/`
- Tool root must not contain notes.
- Any new tool note must be added to `tools/index.md` (newest-first) with the required fields.
- Agents are expected to follow a rule-first, note-driven workflow: consult `.cursor/rules/` then `tools/index.md`, then open linked procedure notes.

## Bootstrap artifacts to be created next (planned, not yet created)

These are *placeholders* for the context-transfer pack that this anchor will point to as they are created:

- `tools/cfc-drift-recalibration-protocol/methodology/YYYY-MM-DD--cdrp-bootstrap-context-pack.md`  
  Purpose: what CDRP is, why it exists, invariants, error model, and success criteria for bootstrap.

- `tools/cfc-drift-recalibration-protocol/methodology/YYYY-MM-DD--cdrp-agent-instantiation-prompt.md`  
  Purpose: the single-purpose agent startup prompt that instructs the new agent to read this anchor + the context pack first.

- `tools/cfc-drift-recalibration-protocol/methodology/YYYY-MM-DD--cdrp-indexing-and-ecosystem-placement.md`  
  Purpose: how CDRP registers in `tools/index.md` and how it relates to the existing Epistemic Contract toolchain.

## Definition of “done” for the bootstrap phase

Bootstrap is considered complete when:

- the dedicated CDRP agent can be instantiated from repo-backed artifacts
- the agent begins with the correct constraints and understands it is in bootstrap mode
- the relationship to the existing Epistemic Contract tool is explicit and coherent
- the tool is indexed properly in `tools/index.md`

## Build log (append-only)

- 2026-01-18: Created CDRP tool folder + this bootstrap anchor. No other CDRP artifacts created yet.
