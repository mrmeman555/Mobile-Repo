Summary: Formalizes a hierarchical self-calibration mechanism: validating true upper-bound domain potential (not isolated wins) reweights all achievements, restoring coherence and motivation while reducing effort and preventing fragmentation.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> When one achievement is accurately framed at the true upper bound of my capability, it reweights all other achievements automatically. Validation must occur at the level of **domain-level potential**, not isolated instances, to generalize and stabilize motivation.

## Purpose of This Note

This note formalizes a critical self-calibration mechanism:

- Why certain framings immediately restore motivation and coherence
- Why hedged or instance-level praise fails
- How validating **upper-bound potential** retroactively validates all achievements

This artifact preserves the method that *works* for my system.

---

## Core Recognition

The effect I experienced is diagnostic:

- Accurate upper-bound framing produced **energy**, not inflation
- Other achievements became validated **without additional argument**
- Effort decreased while motivation increased

This indicates that my self-model is **hierarchical**, not fragmented.

---

## Mechanism (Why This Works)

My identity operates as a domain-level capability model:

- Local achievements are evaluated relative to an implicit ceiling
- If the ceiling is underfit or denied, all instances feel provisional
- If the ceiling is acknowledged accurately, instances snap into coherence

Therefore:
> Validation at the wrong abstraction level (single achievements) cannot generalize.

Validation at the correct level (upper-bound domain potential) **does**.

---

## Failure Mode This Corrects

Instance-only validation causes:
- constant re-proving
- exhaustion
- fragmentation
- motivation leakage

Typical symptoms:
- “This one was good, but…”
- “That mattered, but maybe not really…”
- Requiring repeated reassurance

These are not confidence problems.
They are **mis-scaled validation problems**.

---

## Correct Intervention (What Actually Works)

The effective intervention is:
- Explicitly naming the **class of problems I can solve**
- Framing achievements as evidence of **domain-level domination**
- Allowing upper-bound trajectories to be inhabited without guilt

Once the domain is validated:
- past work feels worth it
- future ambition feels safe
- present effort feels proportional

---

## Diagnostic Test (Use Going Forward)

A framing is correct for my system if it:

- Fits the true upper bound without distortion
- Causes other achievements to connect automatically
- Reduces effort rather than increasing it
- Produces calm energy, not agitation

If it fails this test, it is underfitting reality.

---

## Key Principle (Compressed)

> Validation must target **potential**, not instances, or it will not generalize.

---

## Operational Use

When motivation dips or achievements feel isolated:
- Re-anchor to upper-bound domain capability
- Do not re-argue each instance
- Restore the ceiling; the rest will follow

---

## High-Compression Summary

Accurately validating upper-bound domain potential reweights all achievements automatically, restoring coherence and motivation; instance-level validation is insufficient for hierarchical self-models.

---

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> Validating the upper bound of my capability validates all achievements; instance-level validation does not generalize.

---

## Status

This calibration mechanism is **recognized, formalized, and retained**.
Future motivation and self-trust should be restored by targeting the domain level, not isolated wins.
