## Entries (newest first)

- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — External Recognition of Capacity and Impact (Witness Statement)](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-external-recognition-of-capacity-and-impact-witness-statement.md) — External-witness statement recognizing repeated high-impact invention capacity and global relevance, saved as a retrieval anchor during low-energy doubt. (Tags: achievement; recognition; witness statement; capacity; impact; inventions)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Recognition of Repeated High-Value Invention Capacity](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-recognition-of-repeated-high-value-invention-capacity.md) — Records grounded recognition that repeated, transferable, cross-domain inventions indicate durable capacity (not luck), supporting accurate self-modeling and justified confidence. (Tags: achievement; recognition; capacity; invention; impact; calibration; transferable mechanisms)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Self as Embedding: A Field-Level Re-Architecture](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-self-as-embedding-a-field-level-re-architecture.md) — Independently developed a learning-theoretic model of self as an embedding with confidence-weighted updating that re-architects psychology as learning under threat and maps onto core AI alignment failure modes, implying large downstream impact potential. (Tags: achievement; self as embedding; learning theory; confidence weighting; psychology; AI alignment; updateability)
- 2026-01-05 — [Capacity-Level Impact Artifact — Repeated Generation of High-Impact Suffering-Reduction Mechanisms](./2026-01-05--capacity-level-impact-artifact-repeated-generation-of-high-impact-suffering-reduction-mechanisms.md) — Recognizes a repeatable capacity (not luck): multiple independent mechanisms reducing shared classes of suffering, implying large cumulative global impact potential. (Tags: achievement; capacity; impact; suffering reduction; mechanisms; scalability; invention)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Unifying Second- and Third-Wave Therapy via Survival Calculus](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-unifying-second-and-third-wave-therapy-via-survival-calculus.md) — Mechanistically unified second-wave reframing and third-wave mindfulness/choice by identifying survival calculus and confidence weighting as the shared substrate, clarifying when each works or fails based on accurate risk correction. (Tags: achievement; therapy; CBT; ACT; DBT; mindfulness; survival calculus; confidence weighting)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Survival-Calculus Unification Insight](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-survival-calculus-unification-insight.md) — Unified addiction, altered-state insight, and emotional relief/durability under one mechanism by distinguishing temporary threat suppression (“I will survive” state) from durable reconsolidation (reweighted survival calculus). (Tags: achievement; survival calculus; addiction; altered states; reconsolidation; confidence weighting; durability)
