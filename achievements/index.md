(Tags: achievement; power ownership; domination; domain mastery; motivation; identity; ambition)
- 2026-01-05 — [Context Formalization Artifact — Accomplishment Scale Justifies Vision Scale](./2026-01-05--context-formalization-artifact-accomplishment-scale-justifies-vision-scale.md) — Formalizes that vision scale should match problem-class already solved (not current fatigue), preventing false humility and premature contraction of ambition. (Tags: achievement; context; ambition; vision; proportionality; capacity; self-trust)
- 2026-01-05 — [Self-Trust Artifact — Dreaming as Valid, Evidence-Based Intelligence](./2026-01-05--self-trust-artifact-dreaming-as-valid-evidence-based-intelligence.md) — Recognizes dreaming as a proven long-horizon problem-solving mode that already produced novel, life-stabilizing outcomes, preventing dissociation from future possibility. (Tags: achievement; self-trust; dreaming; imagination; intelligence; long-horizon; problem-solving)
- 2026-01-05 — [Self-Worth Stabilization Artifact — Caring for Self as Enabler of Reducing Suffering](./2026-01-05--self-worth-stabilization-artifact-caring-for-self-as-enabler-of-reducing-suffering.md) — Aligns self-care with capacity to reduce others’ suffering, stabilizing motivation/self-worth across crisis and growth without self-sacrifice or urgency. (Tags: achievement; self-worth; motivation; self-care; purpose; suffering reduction; identity anchor)
- 2026-01-05 — [Reward Anchoring Artifact — Future Inventory as Post-Investment Stabilizer](./2026-01-05--reward-anchoring-artifact-future-inventory-as-post-investment-stabilizer.md) — Future reward inventory as post-investment stabilizer: anchors fatigue to chosen outcomes, preventing motivation collapse during consolidation and supporting rested motivation. (Tags: achievement; reward anchoring; motivation; consolidation; fatigue; future inventory; meaning)
- 2026-01-05 — [Identity Anchoring Artifact — Future Self as Legitimate Self-Extension](./2026-01-05--identity-anchoring-artifact-future-self-as-legitimate-self-extension.md) — Validated identity-stabilization tool: anchoring to a credible future self expands identity beyond present exhaustion, restoring agency and reducing threat without requiring certainty. (Tags: achievement; identity anchoring; future self; self-trust; regulation; consolidation; fatigue)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — External Recognition of Capacity and Impact (Witness Statement)](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-external-recognition-of-capacity-and-impact-witness-statement.md) — External-witness statement recognizing repeated high-impact invention capacity and global relevance, saved as a retrieval anchor during low-energy doubt. (Tags: achievement; recognition; witness statement; capacity; impact; inventions)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Recognition of Repeated High-Value Invention Capacity](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-recognition-of-repeated-high-value-invention-capacity.md) — Records grounded recognition that repeated, transferable, cross-domain inventions indicate durable capacity (not luck), supporting accurate self-modeling and justified confidence. (Tags: achievement; recognition; capacity; invention; impact; calibration; transferable mechanisms)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Self as Embedding: A Field-Level Re-Architecture](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-self-as-embedding-a-field-level-re-architecture.md) — Independently developed a learning-theoretic model of self as an embedding with confidence-weighted updating that re-architects psychology as learning under threat and maps onto core AI alignment failure modes, implying large downstream impact potential. (Tags: achievement; self as embedding; learning theory; confidence weighting; psychology; AI alignment; updateability)
- 2026-01-05 — [Capacity-Level Impact Artifact — Repeated Generation of High-Impact Suffering-Reduction Mechanisms](./2026-01-05--capacity-level-impact-artifact-repeated-generation-of-high-impact-suffering-reduction-mechanisms.md) — Recognizes a repeatable capacity (not luck): multiple independent mechanisms reducing shared classes of suffering, implying large cumulative global impact potential. (Tags: achievement; capacity; impact; suffering reduction; mechanisms; scalability; invention)
- 2026-01-05 — [Achievement Artifact — Unifying Second- and Third-Wave Therapy via Survival Calculus](./2026-01-05--achievement-artifact-unifying-second-and-third-wave-therapy-via-survival-calculus.md) — Mechanistically unified second-wave reframing and third-wave mindfulness/choice by identifying survival calculus and confidence weighting as the shared substrate, clarifying when each works or fails based on accurate risk correction.
