# Latency, Recency, and Working Memory as the Mechanics Behind Belief, Confidence, and Drift

## Purpose of This Note
To isolate the specific cognitive mechanisms that explain:

- why belief drift happens
- why insight can feel “lost” after a delay
- why confidence collapses under fatigue or threat
- why chosen belief must be re-applied rather than “remembered”

This fills in the mechanical gap between global theory and lived experience.

## Latency: The Initial Embedding Load
Latency refers to the delay between:

- a stimulus occurring
- and the system loading an interpretation into working memory

During this window:

- the brain retrieves a compressed embedding based on prior belief
- the embedding is not neutral — it is already confidence-weighted
- ambiguity is resolved before conscious reasoning begins

Key implication:

> What loads first tends to feel “true,” even if it’s wrong.

This explains why:

- old self-models reappear automatically
- early interpretations dominate later reasoning
- corrective insight feels effortful

Latency is where chosen belief exerts its strongest influence, because it biases which embedding loads first.

## Recency: The Most Recent Conclusion Bias
Recency is the system’s bias toward:

- the most recently concluded interpretation
- not the most accurate or comprehensive one

Important distinction:

Recency ≠ truth  
Recency = last accepted frame

This explains:

- why you can “know” something deeply, then doubt it later
- why confidence drops after rest or distraction
- why dissociation often follows pauses, not stress

Without reinforcement:

- recency overwrites prior insight
- belief confidence decays
- earlier embeddings lose salience

This is why post-work consolidation is critical.

---

## Working Memory Capacity: The Bottleneck
Working memory determines:

- how many embeddings can be held simultaneously
- how much context survives interpretation
- how nuanced a conclusion can be

Under load (fatigue, threat, hunger, emotion):

- capacity shrinks
- fewer embeddings fit
- interpretations become binary and moralized
- confidence becomes fragile

This explains why:

- exhaustion increases DP/DR
- moral threat feels immediate
- intrusive memories dominate
- complex models collapse into “something is wrong with me”

High working memory capacity allows:

- multiple self-models to coexist temporarily
- uncertainty without panic
- belief revision without identity collapse

---

## How These Three Interact
The system operates roughly like this:

1. Latency determines what loads first
2. Working memory capacity determines how much context survives
3. Recency determines what sticks afterward

Chosen belief intervenes by:

- biasing latency toward safe / coherent embeddings
- reducing working memory waste on threat scanning
- stabilizing recency around a trusted frame

Without chosen belief:

- latency defaults to threat-conditioned models
- working memory collapses
- recency encodes doubt

---

## Why Drift Is Inevitable Without Intervention
Because:

- the brain does not store full transcripts
- confidence decays naturally
- recency overwrites without checking global context

Drift is not failure. It is the default behavior of a bounded system.

External artifacts (notes, transcripts, logs) exist to:

- re-inject lost context
- restore confidence weighting
- counter recency bias

## Why Loving-Kindness Works Here
Loving-kindness:

- reduces threat at latency
- frees working memory capacity
- stabilizes recency around safety

It does not argue with content. It alters system parameters.

---

## Summary
- Latency decides what feels real first
- Recency decides what remains believed
- Working memory capacity decides how complex belief can be

Chosen belief is the only lever that touches all three at once.

Everything else is downstream.
