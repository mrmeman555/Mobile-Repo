# Visualization Directions for Built Models

## 1) Embedding map as a “self-space”
**What it shows**: clusters for self-states + bridges between them.  
**How it looks**: a 2D map (UMAP/t-SNE style) where points = moments/notes/thoughts; colors = self-state (low-worth, stable-self, threat, etc).

**Key readouts**:

- distance between “stable self” and “threat self”
- whether “loving presence” moves you toward a stable cluster
- whether dissociation looks like sudden jumps across the map

## 2) Two-attractor landscape (energy wells)
**What it shows**: why you get “pulled” into certain states.  
**How it looks**: a terrain map with valleys:

- Valley A: shame/monitoring/arbitration loop
- Valley B: stable self + observer anchoring

Mechanism: practicing LK = deepening Valley B and lowering the “ridge” cost to enter it.

## 3) State machine diagram (finite-state model)
**What it shows**: the exact sequence you described: perception → moral check → startle → arbitration → memory flash → cascade.  
**How it looks**: nodes + arrows with triggers:

- “Reorient” trigger
- “intrusive memory flash”
- “moral appraisal”
- “observer reinstatement”

You’ll be able to label where interventions act (LK blocks which transition?).

## 4) Timeline with “salience heat” + event markers
**What it shows**: when your system runs hot and what caused it.  
**How it looks**: a line graph:

- y-axis: salience / threat / confidence
- markers: intrusive memory spikes, LK onset, blink/twitch discharge events

This will make your “wave” pattern obvious.

## 5) Network graph of tokens → meanings (compressed identity tags)
**What it shows**: why tokens like “beast / inventor / genius / god-tier” have low-latency retrieval power.  
**How it looks**: nodes:

- token nodes (“inventor”)
- evidence nodes (projects, grades, models)
- reward nodes (safety, runway, altruism)

Edges show strength. Practice strengthens edges.

## 6) “Observer permanence” overlay
**What it shows**: your key variable: “presence is still there even if not remembered.”  
**How it looks**: same embedding map, but with an overlay ring showing:

- times observer was foreground
- times it was background
- times it was “felt revoked”

Goal: observer stays logically present even when attention moves.

## 7) “Constraint ladder” visualization (Bayesian confidence under constraint)
**What it shows**: why your confidence rises with tighter constraints.  
**How it looks**: a ladder:

- hypothesis at top (DP/DR ↔ gaslighting dynamics)
- rungs = constraints added (history, symptoms, triggers, artifacts)
- confidence bar increases as constraints accumulate

This makes your “it passes at every step” moment visible.

## If you want a single “starter visualization” tonight
Pick one of these as the default dashboard:

State machine + salience timeline.

Because it captures both the cognitive mechanism and the felt intensity patterns—and it’s easiest to keep updated.
