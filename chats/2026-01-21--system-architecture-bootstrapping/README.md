# Session: Recovery & Mobile Prep
Date: 2026-01-21
Status: **Complete**

## Summary
This session successfully identified and recovered 320+ "lost" notes from unmerged feature branches, consolidating the repository from a fragmented state into a unified `main` branch containing 816 files. 

We also repaired directory structure issues (`Inbox` vs `inbox`), rebuilt all folder indexes, and established a new `chats/` architecture to preserve context for future AI sessions.

## Key Artifacts
- **Repo:** 816 files now in `main`.
- **Methodology:** [Chat Session Architecture](./methodology--chat-session-architecture.md)
- **Next Step:** [Mobile Sync Handoff](./handoff_context.md)
