# Handoff Context: Mobile Sync Setup
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Repo State:** Clean, Consolidated, 816 Files.
**Current Branch:** `main`

## The Goal
The user needs to read/write these notes on their phone (iOS/Android).
They have chosen the **External Git Client** method (e.g., Working Copy for iOS, MGit for Android) because the Obsidian Git plugin is unstable on mobile.

## The Instructions for the Next AI
"You are the Mobile Workflow Architect. The repository is fully prepped. The user wants to set up **Working Copy (iOS)** or **MGit (Android)** to sync this repo, and then point Obsidian Mobile to that local folder.

**Your First Steps:**
1. Ask the user: 'Are you on **iOS** or **Android**?'
2. Based on the answer, provide the specific, step-by-step tutorial to:
   - Clone `mrmeman555/Mobile-Repo`.
   - Authenticate (Token vs Password).
   - Configure the 'Sync Folder' so Obsidian can see it.
3. Help the user verify they can see the 816 notes on their phone."
