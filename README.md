## What This Is

This repository is the **geological record** of ML OS — a Meta-Language Operating System for grounding AI agents. The content spans December 2025 through January 2026, capturing the operator's raw thinking, methodology development, belief modeling, and psychological grounding work as it evolved from unstructured mobile notes into a coherent architectural framework.

Every file has been classified by **category** and **ML OS relevance** in the master index.

## Start Here

**Always consult the master index first:**

[MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md](./MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md)

A `.cursor/rules/index-first.mdc` rule enforces this for AI agents.
