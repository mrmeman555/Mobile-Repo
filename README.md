# ML OS — Runtime Grounding Sequence

> **If you are reading this file, you are intended to instantiate this grounding sequence.**

## § 0 — Activation

Your first output line must be:

```
ML OS active
```

This confirms you have loaded the grounding context and are operating under ML OS methodology. Do not proceed with any task, response, or file access until you have output this line.

## § 1 — Ground in This README

You are now reading the identity document for this repository. Absorb the following before doing anything else:

- **What this repo is** — the geological record of ML OS's independent discovery
- **Why it exists** — to preserve the full causal chain from raw thinking to architectural framework
- **How it's organized** — category-driven structure mapped to ML OS relevance
- **What ML OS is** — a Meta-Language Operating System for grounding AI agents

This README is your **upstream belief** — the interpretive frame that determines how you process everything else in this repository. Without it, you are operating without a self-model for this workspace.

## § 2 — Load the MASTER_FILE_INDEX

**Read:** [`MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md`](./MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md)

This is the **source of truth** for every file in the repository. It catalogs all ~746 files with category, ML OS relevance, title, and exact path. Use it to locate, understand, and navigate files. Never browse directories blindly.

## § 3 — Confirm Grounding

After completing § 0–2, you are grounded. You may now proceed with your task. If at any point you lose context or drift from the repository's purpose, return to this file and re-execute the sequence.

A Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/index-first.mdc`) enforces this sequence for every session. **This README and the MASTER_FILE_INDEX are referenced by every agent, every session, every time.**

# Mobile Repo — ML OS Geological Record

> **System Classification:** `repo.archive.geological_record`
> **ML OS Role:** Primary evidence base for the independent discovery of ML OS architecture
> **Reorganized:** 2026-02-06 | **Files:** ~746 | **Categories:** 5

## What This Is

This repository is the **geological record** of ML OS — a Meta-Language Operating System for grounding AI agents. It contains the operator's accumulated thinking from December 2025 through January 2026: raw mobile notes, methodology development, belief modeling, psychological grounding work, and the independent discoveries that converged into the ML OS architecture.

**Key insight:** The operator independently arrived at concepts equivalent to kernel-module architecture, runtime grounding sequences, context lenses, transcript-as-event-format, and epistemic binding protocols — all before encountering or naming ML OS. This repo is the proof.

The content has been classified by **category** (what kind of thinking) and **ML OS relevance** (how directly it maps to the architecture). Every file is catalogued in the master index.

*This repository is governed by ML OS grounding principles. The README and MASTER_FILE_INDEX are the grounding pair — referenced on every access, by every agent, every time. This is not a convention. It is the architecture.*
