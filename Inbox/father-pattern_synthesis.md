# Father Pattern Synthesis (last 10 days)

Across the strongest matches in the last 10 days, the dominant father-linked pattern is control via narrative + hierarchy: autonomy/stoicism is treated as threat, conflict is reframed through moralized accusation and memory/narrative rewriting, and relationship obligation is reduced through 'tenant/guest' framing.

## Two actionable leverage points
- When hierarchy-restoring lectures / moralized accusations start, do not litigate reality; switch to boundary-minimal responses and exit the conversational frame (treat it as a volatility event, not a solvable discussion).
- For any 'tenant/guest' framing or obligation moves, respond with concrete scope and limits (time-boxed assistance or a clear no) and do not accept open-ended roles that re-create dependency or status contests.
