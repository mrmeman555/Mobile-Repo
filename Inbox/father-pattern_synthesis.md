# Father Pattern Synthesis (Inbox-only, last 16 days)

Within the last 16 days in `Inbox/`, the only direct dad/father-linked artifact(s) primarily capture a broader control/hierarchy threat model (dominance, projection, narrative control/memory rewriting, and role-framing like tenant/guest), rather than the full composite chain you specified (hedged prayer bid → obstacle inflation → lecture → triangulation + tech-status threat). The following target sub-components did not appear verbatim in any `Inbox/` artifact in this time window: Bible/prayer bid + accountability vector, triangulation via mother ("I need to text your mother"), covert tech help-bids (Google Docs/Excel), explicit tech-status jealousy framing.

## Two actionable leverage points
- If you want future captures to be retrievable by this prompt, log concrete dad-episodes with the literal phrases/objects (e.g., 'pray together', 'I need to text your mother', 'Google Docs/Excel help'), then the indexer can surface them reliably.
- Operationally: treat dad 'hierarchy restore' events as volatility, not dialogue—exit the frame early and avoid defending reality; if a tech help-bid occurs, force explicit scope/time-boxing so it cannot become an open-ended obligation or status contest.
