# Father Pattern Synthesis (user_context-only, last 16 days)

Across the top matches in `user_context/` (last 16 days), the recurring dad/father-linked structure is coercion + narrative control: pressure applied to force decisions, followed by retroactive story-rewriting and moralized framing that preserves hierarchy/control. Some of the specific composite components you listed are not present verbatim in `user_context/` within this time window: triangulation via mother ("I need to text your mother"), covert tech help-bids (Google Docs/Excel).

## Two actionable leverage points
- If you want future indexing to reliably surface the prayer/triangulation/tech-help episodes, capture them as standalone artifacts containing the literal trigger phrases/objects ('pray together', 'text your mother', 'Google Docs', 'Excel') so retrieval stays deterministic.
- In the moment: treat moralizing correction/lecture as a hierarchy-restoration move; do not debate facts, and do not accept open-ended obligation bids—force explicit scope + time-boxes or decline.
