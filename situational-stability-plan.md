# Situational Stability & Containment Plan

## Purpose
This document exists to:
- Maintain my internal reality under external pressure
- Reduce volatility while I remain in a constrained environment
- Prevent reactive decisions that would worsen my long-term outcomes
- Serve as a reference when stress distorts memory or judgment

This is a temporary strategy.  
This is not my identity.  
This is not a moral statement.  
This is about survival, stability, and time.

That last line is important. It keeps this file from turning into something global or ideological.

## Current Situation (Summary)

- I am temporarily living in an environment with high emotional volatility.
- Direct authenticity, boundary assertion, or corrective communication increases risk.
- Certain individuals respond to perceived independence or disagreement with withdrawal or escalation.
- My short-term goal is stability, not resolution.
- My long-term goal is exit with resources, health, and autonomy intact.

If you ever reread this and feel the urge to add adjectives — don’t. That’s a sign you should move to another section instead.

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- I cannot change other people’s personalities, beliefs, or coping strategies.
- I cannot rely on being accurately perceived.
- I cannot force empathy or accountability.
- I cannot escalate without cost.
- I cannot “win” arguments here.

Acknowledging constraints is not agreement.  
It is orientation.

This is where you protect yourself from the urge to “just explain it better.”

## Active Strategy (Temporary)

Primary objectives:
- Reduce attention and volatility
- Preserve housing stability
- Preserve mental bandwidth
- Buy time

Key behaviors:
- Polite, warm, non-confrontational tone
- No correction of narratives that do not materially affect safety
- No diagnostic language
- No re-litigation of past events
- Short, neutral explanations only when required
- Predictable routines where possible

You can add bullet points as you notice patterns that work.

## Non-Negotiables (Red Lines)

I do NOT:
- Internalize blame that is factually false
- Confess to things I did not do
- Argue for my worth
- Seek validation for my reality
- Reveal long-term plans
- Share vulnerabilities that can be used against me
- Make permanent decisions based on temporary pressure

This is one of the most important sections. Read it when you feel pulled to “just be honest.”

---

## Internal Rules

- Compliance ≠ belief
- Calm ≠ agreement
- Silence ≠ surrender
- Strategy ≠ dishonesty
- This phase ends when I am resourced enough to leave

I am allowed to protect myself without explaining myself.

If you ever feel shame creeping in, this is the section to reread.

---

## Standing Internal Truth

Even when things are calm:
- The underlying dynamics have not changed
- My anger is not a problem — it is protective memory
- I do not need to re-litigate or resolve it
- I only need to remember it exists

Calm is tactical.  
Distance is intentional.  
Connection is conditional.

---

## Exit Conditions

This strategy ends or loosens when:
- I have stable income or savings
- I have independent housing options
- My health and energy are reliably higher
- External leverage increases
- The cost of staying exceeds the cost of leaving

Re-evaluate monthly, not daily.

The “not daily” part is critical. Daily evaluation creates anxiety loops.

---

## Final Reminder

This situation is not evidence of my worth.  
It is evidence of constraint.

I am acting intelligently within limited options.  
This is temporary.  
I am moving forward even when it doesn’t look like it.

## How to Use This File

Do not edit it while escalated.

Read it when:
- you feel confused
- you want to explain yourself
- you feel compelled to confess or over-justify

Update it only when calm and clear.

If you want, next we can:
- turn this into a one-page SOP
- add a decision tree (“If X happens → do Y”)
- compress it into a pocket version you can glance at quickly
