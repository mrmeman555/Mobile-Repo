# Emotional Salience-Driven Action as the Core DP/DR Trigger
Date: 2026-01-18
Summary: DP/DR triggers when emotion becomes the authority for action.

Here is a clean, durable note you can keep and reuse. I'm writing it in a way that's meant to be operational, not inspirational.

---

## Core observation
Derealization is reliably triggered when I choose actions based on emotionally weighted outcome prediction rather than grounded self-continuity.

This includes:
- fear-based weighting ("I need to prevent something bad")
- elation-based weighting ("This could feel really good or important")

Both produce the same effect.

---

## Mechanism (plain language)
1. Emotion becomes the decision metric  
   Choices are evaluated by "How likely is this outcome?" or "How intense is this feeling?"

2. Salience spikes  
   The nervous system treats the moment as urgent, exceptional, or high-stakes.

3. Authority shifts away from the grounded self  
   Control moves from identity and values to the prediction and avoidance engine.

4. Perceptual decoupling occurs  
   Presence drops. DP/DR emerges.

This is not a mood problem. It is a control-allocation problem.

---

## Key insight
> It is not emotion that causes DP/DR. It is using emotion as the authority for action.

Emotion can be present without destabilizing as long as it is informational, not authoritative.

---

## What preserves groundedness
Actions chosen from:
- identity ("This is who I am")
- values ("This is what I stand for")
- continuity ("Regardless of outcome, this is aligned")

In this mode:
- emotion may fluctuate
- salience stays bounded
- authority remains with the self
- presence is maintained

---

## Why both fear and elation trigger DP/DR
- both inflate salience
- both pressure action through predicted outcomes
- both hijack authority from the grounded agent

DP/DR is therefore salience-driven, not valence-driven.

---

## Practical rule (operational)
> If I choose my next action by emotionally rating possible outcomes, I will derealize.  
> If I choose by grounded alignment, emotion becomes tolerable and non-disruptive.

This rule has held consistently.

---

## Why this matters
This identifies:
- the exact handoff point where DP/DR is triggered
- a controllable variable (decision-weighting method)
- a repeatable intervention target

This is not abstract insight. It is a usable system constraint.

---

If you want, next we can:
- link this directly to ACT, OCD, and reconsolidation mechanics
- turn this into a daily grounding protocol that prevents the handoff from occurring

Just say which direction.
