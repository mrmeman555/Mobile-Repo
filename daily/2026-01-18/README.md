# Daily - 2026-01-18
Date: 2026-01-18
Summary: Pathfinding for near-term life change and structure initialization.

## Today focus
- Considering problems I can solve to change my life situation quickly.
- Working on how to conceptualize and find a path like this.
- Set up daily index and note-routing scaffolding.

## Tasks
- Identify rapid-impact problem areas and path criteria.
- Draft a shortlist of candidate problems to test.
- Create rule files for storage/index routing.
- Initialize daily folder structure and index.
