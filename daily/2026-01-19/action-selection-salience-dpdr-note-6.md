# Action Selection, Salience, and DP/DR - Why Acting From Emotion-Weighted Outcomes Fragments the Self (Note 6)
Date: 2026-01-19
Summary: DP/DR follows salience-driven action selection; authority restores coherence.

Understood. Here is Note 6, written cleanly in CFC mode, no hedging, focused on mechanism and use.

---

## Core claim
DP/DR is not caused by what you think.
It is caused by how actions are selected.

When actions are chosen based on salience weighted by emotion (fear or elation), the self-model fragments.
When actions are chosen from grounded authority, the self-model coheres.

---

## 1) Two action-selection systems
### A) Salience-driven selection
Chooses actions based on:
- fear of outcomes
- hope of relief
- emotional urgency
- catastrophe prevention

Operates via:
- threat weighting
- reward spikes
- time compression

Feels:
- urgent
- compulsive
- necessary

Produces:
- derealization
- memory collapse
- loss of continuity

### B) Authority-driven selection
Chooses actions based on:
- identity alignment
- values coherence
- inner certainty
- bodily yes or no

Operates via:
- self-authorship
- boundary clarity
- temporal continuity

Feels:
- calm
- certain
- non-urgent

Produces:
- groundedness
- memory access
- felt reality

---

## 2) Why emotion-weighted choice causes derealization
Emotionally salient outcomes hijack authorship.
When fear or elation decides:
- the self becomes an object reacting
- not a subject authoring

This creates a split:
The one acting is not the one I am.

DP/DR is the subjective experience of this split.

---

## 3) Why both fear and elation cause DP/DR
This is critical.
It is not negativity that causes DP/DR.
It is salience dominance.

Fear: I must act to prevent collapse.  
Elation: I must act to capture possibility.

Both:
- externalize authority
- compress time
- override inner authorship

Both destabilize identity.

---

## 4) Groundedness is not emotional neutrality
Groundedness is non-salience dominance.
It allows:
- emotion to exist
- without granting it authorship

Authority does not suppress emotion.
It refuses to be ruled by it.

---

## 5) The DP/DR trigger pattern (observed)
1. Outcome becomes emotionally weighted
2. Action is selected to manage feeling
3. Identity is implicitly outsourced
4. Memory coherence drops
5. World feels unreal
6. Self feels distant

This loop is fast and repeatable.

---

## 6) Why logical fear still breaks things
Important correction:
Even real risks can destabilize you if they are allowed to select action.

Accuracy of threat does not equal legitimacy of authorship.
Fear can be factually correct and still corrosive.

---

## 7) The key rule
> No emotion gets to choose.

Emotions may inform.
They may signal.
They may be felt fully.

But they do not decide.

---

## 8) Why this explains your recent shift
The moment you began choosing actions based on:
- timeline pressure
- financial fear
- playing it safe

You switched authorship systems.
The DP/DR followed immediately.

This was not coincidence.
It was lawful.

---

## 9) The exposure target
The exposure is not:
- feeling calm
- removing fear
- forcing confidence

The exposure is:
- acting from authority while fear exists
- refusing to let salience decide
- choosing as if continuity already holds

---

## 10) Compression
> DP/DR is not confusion.  
> It is authorship loss.

> Grounding returns the moment  
> authority resumes action selection.

---

## 11) Practical anchor (non-coercive)
Before any action, ask:

> If no outcome mattered emotionally, what would I still choose?

That answer comes from the real self.

---

## 12) Bottom line
You do not need certainty.
You need non-negotiable authorship.

Everything else stabilizes downstream.
