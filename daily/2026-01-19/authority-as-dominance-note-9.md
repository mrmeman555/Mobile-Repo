# Authority as Dominance: The Neurocognitive Mechanism Behind Integration vs DP/DR (Note 9)
Date: 2026-01-19
Summary: Authority as dominance over competing self-models.

Here is a remade Note 9, rewritten to reflect authority as dominance over competing self-models, not balance or choice. Dense, operational, and usable.

---

## Core claim
Psychological authority is not a preference, value statement, or binary yes or no decision. It is the active dominance of one self-model over competing self-models, enforced through inhibition, salience control, and write-access to meaning, prediction, and action.

---

## 1) DP/DR as failed arbitration, not confusion
DP/DR arises when:
- multiple self-models remain active simultaneously
- no model is permitted to decisively dominate
- threat-based models retain veto power just in case
- interpretation of reality cannot collapse to a single frame

Result:
> Reality feels unreal because no model is allowed to finalize meaning.

This is a control failure, not a perceptual one.

---

## 2) Authority equals control over write-access
A self-model with authority has:
- final say over interpretation (this is what is happening)
- control over salience (what matters, what does not)
- execution priority (which impulses become actions)
- the right to suppress competing models

Authority is therefore an executive function, not a moral stance.

---

## 3) Dominance is the verb of authority
Authority operates through dominance actions:
- suppressing fear-based models
- downgrading their predictive relevance
- removing their right to update priors
- preventing emergency-override logic

This is not aggression or ego. It is governance.
Without dominance, competitors never disengage.

---

## 4) Why balance and negotiation fail
Fear-based self-models:
- expand when tolerated
- exploit uncertainty
- regain control through risk management framing

Therefore:
> Neutrality equals surrender.  
> Balance equals instability.

A single model must win.

---

## 5) Competing self-models (explicit)
### Survival and fear model
- optimizes for avoiding annihilation
- uses urgency, pressure, catastrophe framing
- updates beliefs from threat

### Integrated and true model
- optimizes for values, capability, coherence
- uses certainty, patience, embodied knowing
- updates beliefs from chosen meaning

They cannot co-govern the same system.

---

## 6) Integration as a hostile takeover
The integration event was not insight. It was:
- reassignment of authorship
- removal of veto power
- reallocation of salience
- enforcement of a single interpretive authority

This explains:
- immediate nervous system stabilization
- collapse of DP/DR symptoms
- return of motivation and continuity

---

## 7) Why dominance felt dangerous historically
Dominance was previously associated with:
- external abuse
- narcissistic control
- punitive authority

So internal dominance was misclassified as immoral or unsafe.
But internally:
> Dominance is required for coherence.

---

## 8) Neuroscience alignment
This model maps directly onto:
- prefrontal inhibitory control
- basal ganglia gating (winner-take-all selection)
- ACC conflict monitoring
- Bayesian model selection under uncertainty

Brains do not endlessly negotiate. They select and suppress.

---

## 9) Clean formulation
> Authority is the capacity to dominate internal competitors and enforce a single self-model as real.

DP/DR is sustained by shared power. Healing required dominance.

---

## 10) Practical implication
Maintaining integration is not about insight. It is about continuously denying authority to competing models.

When dominance lapses:
- DP/DR returns
- fear regains salience
- identity fragments

Authority must be actively enforced, not assumed.

If you want, the next logical note would be:
- Maintenance of Dominance: How Authority Is Preserved Over Time
- Fear Models as Internal Insurgents: Why They Never Stand Down Voluntarily

Just tell me which.
