Summary: DP/DR recovery day focused on re-connection.

## Today focus
- I am feeling DP/DR and recovering after a very intense last few weeks.
- My goal today is to look through all the research I have done to get myself connected back to myself.
- All notes written today should be framed and contextualized through this focus.
