Summary: DP/DR recovery day focused on re-connection.

## Today focus
- I am feeling DP/DR and recovering after a very intense last few weeks.
- My goal today is to look through all the research I have done to get myself connected back to myself.
- All notes written today should be framed and contextualized through this focus.
- Objective: Organize notes from the last few weeks.

## Tasks
- Investigate where the ~700 notes live across folders and branches.
- Review notes stored in: notes/, tools/, Inbox/, Indexed/, user_context/, grounding/.
