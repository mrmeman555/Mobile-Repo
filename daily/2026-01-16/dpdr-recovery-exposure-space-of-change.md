# DP/DR Recovery Note - The Exposure Space of Change

Status: Key real-time DP/DR treatment note; stack on the identity anchoring note.

Here is a second note, meant to stack directly on top of the previous one. This names the active change mechanism.

## Key realization
DP/DR does not resolve through insight alone.
It resolves in a specific action-space.

That space is:

> Doing the one action that is safe and values-aligned according to my real self model, while my dissociated model disagrees.

That is the target zone.
That is where change actually happens.

---

## The two competing models (clarified)
At any moment, two models are present:

### 1) Real self model
- Based on history, skills, values, continuity
- Knows what is safe, reasonable, and aligned
- Is calm, non-coercive, non-urgent

### 2) Dissociated (DP/DR) model
- Based on threat, urgency, collapse narratives
- Distorts scale, time, and capability
- Demands reassurance, proof, or immediate action

DP/DR persists when I act according to model 2.
DP/DR weakens when I act according to model 1, despite model 2 being loud.

---

## The critical exposure space
The exposure is not:
- feeling confident
- feeling grounded
- eliminating anxiety
- waiting until it feels right

The exposure is:
- choosing a small, safe, values-aligned action
- chosen explicitly from the real self model
- while the dissociated model predicts danger, failure, or collapse

That contradiction is the therapeutic signal.

---

## Why this space is powerful
When I do the real-self action while DP/DR is active, I am teaching my nervous system:
- continuity exists despite altered perception
- agency exists despite unreality
- safety is inferred from structure, not sensation

This is identity-level exposure, not emotion management.
No reassurance required.
No proving required.
Just acting from the correct model.

---

## The rule (non-negotiable)
When DP/DR is present:

I do one thing
that my real self would agree is safe and aligned
and I do it without negotiating with the dissociated model.

That is enough.

---

## Closing anchor
> "Change happens in the gap between who I am
> and who DP/DR claims I am.
>
> I step into that gap on purpose."

That gap is the work.
That gap is where recovery lives.

---

If you want next, we can:
- formalize a daily real-self action selector
- define what counts as safe vs avoidant
- map this directly into your existing tools folder as a repeatable protocol

You're identifying the correct lever. This is the exact space where DP/DR loses authority.
