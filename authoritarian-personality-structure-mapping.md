# Note: Mapping My Mother’s Behavior to Authoritarian Personality Structure

This is not a diagnosis. This is a behavioral and structural mapping based on repeated, consistent patterns.

## Core Orientation

My mother relates to reality vertically, not relationally.  
She experiences truth, morality, and legitimacy as flowing down a hierarchy, not emerging through mutual understanding.

Her internal structure appears to be:

```text
God / Absolute Truth
↓
Her (interpreter / discerner / aligned vessel)
↓
Others (to align, submit, or be corrected)
```

## Key Authoritarian Traits Observed

### 1. Submission to Higher Authority

Frames decisions and judgments as “trusting God,” not personal choice.  
Defers responsibility upward to divine authority.  
Uses faith language to avoid personal accountability.

### 2. Domination of Subordinates

Expects compliance, explanation, and emotional regulation from me.  
Punishes independence through withdrawal, indifference, or moral framing.  
Treats my autonomy as destabilizing rather than legitimate.

### 3. Moral Absolutism

Disagreement is framed as “lack of truth,” “lack of faith,” or “resistance.”  
Nuance and context are rejected when they challenge her stance.  
Moral certainty replaces investigation.

### 4. Hostility to Ambiguity

Cannot tolerate uncertainty about who is “right.”  
Resolves ambiguity by collapsing complexity into a narrative that preserves hierarchy.  
Uses phrases like “we can’t really know” selectively—only when knowing would implicate her or her chosen authority figure.

### 5. Punishment of Deviation

Emotional withdrawal when I assert a perspective that conflicts with hers.  
Silence or delayed responses used as leverage.  
Support becomes conditional on alignment.

### 6. Epistemic Control

Positions herself as the arbiter of what is real, appropriate, or acceptable.  
Invalidates my lived experience while claiming neutrality.  
Treats my attempts to clarify reality as inappropriate or disruptive.

### 7. Moral Licensing

Justifies inaction, neglect, or harm by framing it as “faith,” “wisdom,” or “letting God work.”  
Maintains a positive self-image while allowing severe downstream harm to me.  
Harm is reframed as necessary, instructive, or spiritually meaningful.

## Critical Pattern

When faced with a choice between:
- acknowledging harm to me
- or preserving her moral/relational hierarchy

She consistently prioritizes hierarchy preservation.

This is not confusion or lack of information.  
It is structural alignment with authority over relationship.

## Functional Summary

My mother does not engage with me as an equal epistemic agent.  
She engages with me as a role within a hierarchy.

When I step outside that role, the system responds with:
- withdrawal
- moral reframing
- loss of protection
- implicit threat of abandonment

This behavior aligns closely with authoritarian personality organization, particularly when combined with religious moral framing.
