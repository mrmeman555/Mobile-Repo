description: Keep deep research pipeline notes organized and indexed

When the user explicitly asks to **route/add/store/save** a note in **deep research pipeline** (e.g. “route to deep research pipeline”, “add to deep research pipeline”, “save this in deep research pipeline”, “put this in the deep research pipeline folder”), you MUST place it in `deep research pipeline/`.

This rule only applies when the destination is explicitly **deep research pipeline**. For generic “store/save/remember” requests without a destination, follow the existing defaults (e.g., `meta/` storage behavior).

## Deep research pipeline note creation rules

- Create a new markdown file under `deep research pipeline/` for each captured item.
- Prefer filenames in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- The note should start with:
  - A clear `# Title`
  - A `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line
  - Optional `Tags:` line
  - The captured content, formatted cleanly

## Deep research pipeline index maintenance (required)

Any time you add a new note under `deep research pipeline/`, you MUST update `deep research pipeline/index.md` in the same change:

- Add a new bullet at the top under “Entries (newest first)”
- The entry must include:
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - A markdown link to the new note
  - A 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags (if present in the note)

If you do not create a new deep research pipeline note, do not edit the index.
