description: Keep PoE notes organized and indexed

When the user explicitly asks to **route/add/store/save** a note in **PoE** (or uses **“Plex”** as an alias for PoE) (e.g. “route to PoE”, “route to Plex”, “add to PoE”, “add to Plex”, “save this in PoE”, “put this in the PoE folder”, “Path of Exile notes”), you MUST place it in `PoE/`.

This rule only applies when the destination is explicitly **PoE / Plex / Path of Exile**. For generic “store/save/remember” requests without a destination, follow the existing defaults (e.g., `meta/` storage behavior).

## PoE note creation rules

- Create a new markdown file under `PoE/` for each captured item.
- Prefer filenames in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- The note should start with:
  - A clear `# Title`
  - A `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line
  - Optional `Tags:` line
  - The captured content, formatted cleanly

## PoE index maintenance (required)

Any time you add a new note under `PoE/`, you MUST update `PoE/index.md` in the same change:

- Add a new bullet at the top under “Entries (newest first)”
- The entry must include:
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - A markdown link to the new note
  - A 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags (if present in the note)

If you do not create a new PoE note, do not edit the PoE index.
