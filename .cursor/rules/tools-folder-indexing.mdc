When the user explicitly asks to **route/add/store/save** a note in **tools** (e.g. “route to tools”, “add to tools”, “save this in tools”, “put this in the tools folder”), you MUST place it in `tools/`.

This rule only applies when the destination is explicitly **tools**. For generic “store/save/remember” requests without a destination, follow the existing defaults (e.g., `meta/` storage behavior).

## Tools note creation rules

- Create a new markdown file under `tools/<tool>/<use-case>/` for each captured item.
- Prefer filenames in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- Folder naming:
  - `<tool>` should be a lowercase, hyphen-separated slug for the tool name (e.g., `epistemic-contract-engineering`).
  - `<use-case>` should be a lowercase, hyphen-separated slug for the context/use-case (e.g., `high-stakes-ai-collaboration`).
- The note should start with:
 - A clear `# Title`
 - A `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line
 - A `Tool:` line
 - A `Use case:` line
 - Optional `Tags:` line
 - Optional `Summary:` line (1–2 sentences)
 - The captured content, formatted cleanly

## Tools index maintenance (required)

Any time you add a new note under `tools/`, you MUST update `tools/index.md` in the same change:

- Add a new bullet at the top under “Entries (newest first)”
- The entry must include:
 - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
 - A markdown link to the new note
 - Which tool the note is related to (e.g., `Tool: <name>`)
 - Which use-case the note is related to (e.g., `Use case: <name>`)
 - A 1–2 line summary
 - Optional tags (if present in the note)

If you do not create a new tools note, do not edit the tools index.
