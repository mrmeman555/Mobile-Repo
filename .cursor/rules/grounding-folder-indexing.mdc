description: Keep grounding notes organized and indexed

When the user explicitly asks to **route/add/store/save** a note in **grounding** (e.g. “route to grounding”, “add to grounding”, “save this in grounding”, “put this in the grounding folder”), you MUST place it in `grounding/`.

This rule only applies when the destination is explicitly **grounding**. For generic “store/save/remember” requests without a destination, follow the existing defaults (e.g., `meta/` storage behavior).

## Grounding note creation rules

- Create a new markdown file under `grounding/` for each captured item.
- Prefer filenames in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- The note should start with:
  - A clear `# Title`
  - A `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line
  - Optional `Tags:` line
  - The captured content, formatted cleanly

## Grounding index maintenance (required)

Any time you add a new note under `grounding/`, you MUST update `grounding/index.md` in the same change:

- Add a new bullet at the top under “Entries (newest first)”
- The entry must include:
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - A markdown link to the new note
  - A 1–2 line summary
  - Optional tags (if present in the note)

If you do not create a new grounding note, do not edit the grounding index.
