When the user asks for a **tools governance note** (or equivalent phrasing like “tools governance write-up”, “summarize tools folder rules”, “how are we managing the tools folder?”, “brief another AI on the tools folder”), you MUST output a **current, repo-backed** governance note in chat.

Do NOT create or modify any files unless the user explicitly asks to save the governance note somewhere.

## What the tools governance note must include (required)

1) **Purpose of `tools/`**
- Explain what kind of content belongs in `tools/` (tools/methodologies/protocols/templates).

2) **Folder structure**
- State the canonical structure: `tools/<tool>/<use-case>/`.
- Explain `<tool>` and `<use-case>` as lowercase, hyphen-separated slugs.

3) **Indexing rules**
- Explain that `tools/index.md` is the master index with “Entries (newest first)”.
- Each entry must include: Date, Link, Tool, Use case, Summary, optional Tags.
- Explain that any time a new tools note is added, the index must be updated in the same change.

4) **Note header schema**
- Document the required header fields in each tools note: `# Title`, `Date`, `Tool`, `Use case` (+ optional `Tags`, optional `Summary`, optional `Related:` links).

5) **Available tools & purposes (must be current)**
- Derive the list of tools and their purposes by reading `tools/index.md` and grouping by Tool.
- For each tool:
  - Tool name (human-readable)
  - Tool folder slug (e.g., `epistemic-contract-engineering`)
  - Use cases present (subfolders)
  - 1–2 sentence purpose summary (from the tool’s primary note or index summaries)
  - Key notes/examples (links)

6) **How to add new content**
- How to add a new note to an existing tool/use-case.
- How to introduce a new tool (create folder, add initial “tool overview” note, update index).
- How to add a new use-case under an existing tool.

## Sources of truth (required)

- `tools/index.md`
- `.cursor/rules/tools-folder-indexing.mdc`
