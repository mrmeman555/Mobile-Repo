description: Store requested memories in meta/ and keep meta/index.md updated

If the user asks you to **store/remember/save** something (e.g. “store this”, “remember this”, “save this for later”, “put this in your memory”), you MUST create a note in the `meta/` folder unless the user explicitly specifies a different destination.

This rule overrides the default “inbox” behavior: **storage requests go to `meta/`.**

## What counts as a “storage request”

Treat these as storage requests:
- “store this”, “save this”, “remember this”, “keep this”, “log this”
- “put this in meta”, “add this to meta”, “add to your notes”
- Any instruction whose primary intent is to preserve information for later retrieval

Do NOT treat ordinary discussion or transient planning as a storage request unless the user explicitly asks to store it.

## Meta note creation rules

- Create a new markdown file under `meta/` for each stored item.
- Prefer filenames in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- The note should start with:
  - `# <Title>`
  - `Date: YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Optional `Tags: tag1, tag2`
  - A short `Summary:` line (1–2 sentences)
- Then include the stored content, using headings/lists as appropriate.

## Meta index maintenance (required)

Any time you add a new note under `meta/`, you MUST update `meta/index.md` in the same change:

- Add a new bullet at the top under “Entries (newest first)”
- The entry must include:
  - Date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - A markdown link to the new note
  - The note’s `Summary:` (or a 1–2 line summary if none exists)
  - Optional tags (if present)

If you do not create a new meta note, do not edit the meta index.

## Retrieval convention (for later)

When the user asks what you have stored, consult `meta/index.md` first, then open the linked meta notes as needed.
