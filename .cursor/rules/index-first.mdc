# Index-First Access Rule — Mobile Repo

> **Scope:** All files under `/home/aaron/Projects/Mobile-Repo/`
> **Purpose:** Ensure agents always consult the master index before accessing any file.

## Rule

**Before accessing, reading, moving, creating, or modifying ANY file in this repository, you MUST first consult:**

`/home/aaron/Projects/Mobile-Repo/MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md`

This index catalogs every file in the repository with:
- **Category** (ARCH, METH, BEL, PSY, PERS)
- **ML OS Relevance** (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW)
- **Title and summary**
- **Exact file path**

## How to Use

1. If you need to find a file: search the index by keyword, category, or relevance level
2. If you need to understand a file's purpose: the index has the summary
3. If you need related files: the index groups files by category and subdirectory
4. If you are creating a new file: after creation, you MUST add it to the index
5. If you are moving or deleting a file: you MUST update the index

## Never Do This

- Never browse directories to find files — use the index
- Never access a file without knowing its category and relevance — check the index
- Never modify the repo structure without updating the index
- Never assume you know what's in the repo — the index is the source of truth

## Category Legend

| Code | Meaning | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| ARCH | ML OS Architecture — direct precursors | `architecture/` |
| METH | Methodology — frameworks, pipelines, protocols | `methodology/` |
| BEL | Belief Modeling — epistemology, embedding theory | `theory/` |
| PSY | Psychological — DP/DR, recovery, grounding | `psychology/` |
| PERS | Personal Context — career, trajectory, values | `personal/` |
