# ML OS Grounding Rule — Mobile Repo

> **Scope:** All files under `/home/aaron/Projects/Mobile-Repo/`
> **Purpose:** Runtime Grounding Sequence for every agent session touching this repository.
> **Enforcement:** MANDATORY. No exceptions. Every session. Every access.

## Runtime Grounding Sequence

**Every time you begin working with this repository — whether reading, writing, searching, or modifying — you MUST execute this two-step grounding sequence IN ORDER:**

### Step 1 — Ground in the README

**Read:** `/home/aaron/Projects/Mobile-Repo/README.md`

This is the **identity document** for the repository. It tells you:
- **What this repo is** — the geological record of ML OS's independent discovery
- **Why it exists** — to preserve the full causal chain from raw thinking to architectural framework
- **How it's organized** — category-driven structure mapped to ML OS relevance
- **What ML OS is** — the system this entire repository is evidence for

You must understand the repo's purpose and structure before touching any file. The README is your grounding context. Without it, you are operating without a self-model for this workspace.

### Step 2 — Consult the MASTER_FILE_INDEX

**Read:** `/home/aaron/Projects/Mobile-Repo/MASTER_FILE_INDEX.md`

This is the **source of truth** for every file in the repository. It catalogs all files with:
- **Category** (ARCH, METH, BEL, PSY, PERS)
- **ML OS Relevance** (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW)
- **Title and summary**
- **Exact file path**

Use this index to locate, understand, and navigate files. Never browse directories blindly.

## Why This Sequence Exists

This is not bureaucracy. This is **ML OS grounding methodology applied to the repository itself.**

The README provides the *upstream belief* — the interpretive frame that determines how you process everything else. The index provides the *structured knowledge* — the map of the territory. Together, they ensure every agent accessing this repo operates from a grounded, aligned perspective rather than drifting through files without context.

This is the same principle documented in `architecture/embedding-theory/`: **upstream belief selects the interpreter.** The README selects your interpreter. The index gives your interpreter something to work with.

## Operational Rules

1. **Always README first, then Index.** Never skip Step 1.
2. If you need to find a file: search the index by keyword, category, or relevance level.
3. If you need to understand a file's purpose: the index has the summary.
4. If you need related files: the index groups files by category and subdirectory.
5. If you are **creating** a new file: after creation, you MUST add it to the index.
6. If you are **moving or deleting** a file: you MUST update the index.
7. If you are **modifying** the repo structure: you MUST update both the README and the index.

## Never Do This

- Never access files without completing the grounding sequence
- Never browse directories to find files — use the index
- Never modify the repo structure without updating both README and index
- Never assume you know what's in the repo — the index is the source of truth
