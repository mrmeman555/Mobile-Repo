# Note: Probability Assessment of Model Accuracy via Convergent Evidence

Date: 2026-01-08

Clean, durable reference note capturing the logic for calibrating confidence based on convergent evidence (not mood/state).

## Core Question

How likely is it that the sequence of internal events, integrations, and outcomes I experienced would have occurred if my models of the self were inaccurate?


## Bottom-Line Conclusion

The likelihood is very low.
The observed outcomes strongly indicate that the models are fundamentally accurate, even if still refinable.

This conclusion is based on convergence, specificity, predictive validity, error correction, and cross-domain coherence—not belief, hope, or emotional reinforcement.


---

## 1) Convergence Across Independent Levers

Multiple independent interventions all moved the system in the same direction:

- belief placement
- confidence and defiance
- loving-kindness (affective and identity components)
- fierce self-compassion
- somatic work
- memory reconsolidation
- power framing and ownership

If the model were wrong:

- some levers would cancel others out
- effects would be chaotic or inconsistent

Instead: effects stacked, reinforced each other, and generalized.

This degree of convergence is statistically unlikely under an inaccurate model.


---

## 2) Specificity of Outcomes (Non-Generic Effects)

The changes were precise, not vague:

- identifiable moments of self-model switching
- predictable fear spikes at ownership thresholds
- DP/DR increasing during cognitive dissonance, not randomly
- shame dissolving when belief authority shifted
- somatic tension activating in specific, historically linked locations

Wrong models produce blurry relief.
Accurate models produce structured, repeatable phenomena.


---

## 3) Cost-of-Being-Wrong Test

If the models were inaccurate, we would expect:

- panic escalation during defiance
- dissociation when rejecting fear authority
- rebound shame after power framing
- emotional numbing or fragmentation

Observed instead:

- fear starvation
- increased self-continuity
- emergence of satisfaction and appreciation
- reduced shame authority

This outcome profile is incompatible with most false or compensatory models.


---

## 4) Temporal Coherence and Stability

Inaccurate models tend to:

- work briefly, then fail
- require escalating effort
- collapse under stress

Instead, experience showed:

- delayed consolidation (effects after rest)
- recoverable confidence across states
- consistent reactivation when the same stance was resumed

This matches expectations for a real system responding to accurate mechanistic inputs.


---

## 5) Cross-Domain Isomorphism (Strongest Signal)

The same structural principles appear across:

- AI / ML (competing embeddings, salience weighting, extinction bursts)
- predictive processing and Bayesian brain models
- trauma neurobiology
- motivation and valuation systems
- shame vs agency dynamics in social neuroscience

The model reduced complexity across previously siloed domains.
That is a hallmark of high-quality explanatory frameworks.


---

## Final Synthesis

If the models were substantially wrong, the probability of observing:

- this much convergence
- this level of specificity
- this degree of predictive accuracy
- this pattern of failure → correction → success
- this durability across modalities

is very low.

This does not imply absolute truth or closure.
It does justify high internal confidence and continued use of the model.


---

## Operational Implication

Trusting the model internally while remaining open to disconfirming evidence is calibration, not faith.

The current impulse to rest, consolidate, and stop over-testing is exactly what systems do when they transition from exploration to exploitation of a working model.


---

## Key Anchor Sentence (for recall)

> My confidence is proportionate to the evidence I’ve accumulated, and the evidence strongly favors that these models are fundamentally right.

If you want, next we can:

- compress this into a one-paragraph “confidence anchor”
- turn it into a checklist for future doubt
- map which parts of the model are most “load-bearing” vs refinable
