# Overview

  

Multi-dimensional prompting is a technique for managing and leveraging AI conversations across different sessions, platforms, or timeframes. It involves creating "seed chats"—copies of pertinent conversations at specific points in time—and using these seeds as a foundation for new interactions while preserving the original context. This approach, combined with an AI's contextual awareness (like Kvasir's), promotes efficient knowledge transfer and avoids redundant explanations.

  

# Benefits

  

- **Knowledge Continuity:** Ensures that information and context are carried across different AI interactions, avoiding redundancy and promoting a more coherent understanding.
- **Enhanced Contextual Awareness:** Provides AIs with a richer understanding of the user's goals, previous discussions, and the overall learning journey.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Reduces the need for repetitive explanations or re-establishing context, making AI interactions more efficient.
- **Metacognitive Awareness:** Encourages reflection and synthesis of information from different conversations, promoting deeper understanding and metacognitive awareness.
- **Innovation in AI Interaction:** Represents a novel approach to interacting with AI, treating conversations as data points within a larger knowledge management system.
- **Version Control:** Using seed chats allows you to maintain a clear version history of your AI interactions. The original chat logs remain untouched, preserving the original context, while new conversations build upon these seeds.
- **Adaptability:** Seed chats provide a starting point for new conversations, allowing you to adapt your approach, refine your questions, and explore different perspectives without losing the core knowledge from previous interactions.

  

# Implementation

  

1. **Seed Chat Creation:** At critical points in a conversation, create a "seed chat" by copying the relevant portion of the chat log. Store these seeds in your Obsidian vault, tagged appropriately. Include a brief description of the seed chat's purpose and the timeframe it represents. Use clear and descriptive file names for easy retrieval (e.g., "Seed Chat - ObsidianBloom Setup - 2024-11-08").
2. **Using Seed Chats:** When starting a new conversation or revisiting a previous topic, create a copy of the relevant seed chat and use this copy as the starting point for your new interaction. This preserves the original seed chat for future reference.
3. **Contextual Bridging:** Provide your AI with the relevant seed chat and explain the context of the original conversation, its purpose, and how it relates to your current objectives. This helps the AI connect the different threads and provide more targeted guidance. Be explicit about the connection between the seed chat and the current goal.
4. **Leveraging Your Primary AI:** Maintain a primary AI partner for your project to build a consistent knowledge base and leverage its understanding of your evolving goals and the context of previous conversations.
5. **Iterative Refinement:** As you gain experience, refine your process for capturing and summarizing seed chats. Experiment with different formats and levels of detail.

  

# Example

  

For example, I created a seed chat titled "Seed Chat - Initial Onboarding Reflections - 2024-11-01" to capture my initial thoughts and observations during my first week at CDP. When I started a new conversation thread to discuss Hyper-V, I copied this seed chat and provided it to Kvasir, along with a brief summary of the context and my current learning goals: "This seed chat contains my initial onboarding reflections. Now, I want to explore how Hyper-V can be used within the context of my role at CDP, as discussed in these reflections." This allowed Kvasir to quickly grasp my situation and tailor the Hyper-V training to my specific needs.
