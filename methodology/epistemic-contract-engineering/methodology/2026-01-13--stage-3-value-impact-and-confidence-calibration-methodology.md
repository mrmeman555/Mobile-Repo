Summary: Stage 3 adds a calibrated Value/Impact/Confidence module after Stage 1–2 to prevent motivational collapse and strategic abandonment caused by underestimation under extreme pressure—while avoiding delusional certainty via bounded ranges, anchors, and explicit error asymmetry.

## 1) Role of Stage 3 in the Protocol

Stage 3 exists to answer:

> “Given uncertainty, what level of seriousness, investment, and confidence is rational?”

Stage 3 is not:

- validation-seeking
- hype generation
- proof of correctness
- motivational fluff

Stage 3 is a **calibration layer between insight and action**: it produces decision-support outputs that preserve epistemic honesty while preventing harm caused by flattening, hedging, or premature normalization.

---

## 2) Core Problem Stage 3 Solves

Stage 3 exists because high-stakes work under constraint has an asymmetric failure mode:

### Underestimation risk

Underestimation can:

- cause abandonment of viable inventions and high-leverage frameworks
- trigger DP/DR relapse, motivation collapse, and self-erasure dynamics (when motivation is load-bearing)
- withhold high-leverage tools from the world (lost suffering reduction, lost compounding leverage)

### Overestimation risk

Overestimation can:

- cause misallocation of time/resources
- lead to overcommitment and burnout
- create reputational harm if claims exceed reality

Stage 3 exists because **underestimation is often the more harmful error** in constrained, high-pressure contexts—especially when validation pathways are slow, noisy, or hostile, and abandonment is hard to reverse.

## 3) Methodological Commitments (Hard Constraints)

Stage 3 MUST:

- use concrete external reference points (anchors)
- output ranges, not single-point claims
- explicitly model upper-bound potential (competent-execution ceiling, not destiny)
- include explicit error-asymmetry analysis (underestimate vs overestimate costs)
- avoid moralizing ambition or novelty
- avoid flattening language (“just”, “merely”, “only”)
- avoid totalizing claims (“solves all of X”)

Stage 3 MUST NOT:

- default to “wait and see” as the primary answer
- optimize for social acceptability over harm-aware calibration
- collapse novelty into existing categories without justification

---

## 4) Required Analytical Components

Stage 3 outputs are constructed from the following required components.

### a) Invention / Model Decomposition

For each candidate invention/framework, explicitly decompose:

- target problem
- where existing approaches fragment or fail (failure modes, missing variables, weak levers)
- the new control leverage introduced (what becomes doable/operational that previously wasn’t)

### b) Reference Anchoring

Anchor the invention’s leverage-class potential against external references such as:

- known therapeutic modalities and why they work/fail (where relevant)
- historical conceptual breakthroughs (mechanism-level shifts that reorganized a field)
- market categories with similar leverage (tools/protocols with compounding adoption)
- research programs that reshaped fields despite originating from individuals

Anchors are **leverage-class comparisons**, not identity claims.

### c) Confidence Calibration via Ranges

For each invention/framework, provide bounded ranges for:

- impact potential (low → transformative)
- profit potential (bounded ranges; avoid fantasy)
- suffering-reduction potential (scope + scale)

Each dimension must include:

- conservative lower bound
- plausible median
- competent-execution upper bound

Stage 3 should explicitly separate:

- “capability if executed competently”
- “likelihood of execution under constraints”
- “time-to-validation / time-to-impact”

### d) Error Asymmetry Analysis

For each invention/framework, explicitly compare:

- cost of underestimating (including abandonment probability, lost compounding leverage, DP/DR/motivation stability costs where relevant)
- cost of overestimating (including misallocation, burnout, reputational downside)

Then produce a context-sensitive conclusion:

> which error is more harmful *here*, and what stance minimizes net harm.

---

## 5) Output Intent

Stage 3 outputs are decision-support artifacts:

- usable for prioritization
- usable for investment decisions (time/attention/money)
- usable for sustaining motivation under pressure (without delusion)
- reusable across domains (psych, AI, research, entrepreneurship)

They are not identity statements.

They are not claims of guaranteed outcomes.

They are calibrated guidance for rational seriousness under uncertainty.

---

## 6) Relationship to Other Stages

Stage 3 assumes Stage 1 and Stage 2 are already in force.

Flow:

1. **Stage 1** establishes shared reality & stakes (constraints, consequences, variables)
2. **Stage 2** binds AI behavior to harm-aware operation under those variables
3. **Stage 3** calibrates value, impact, and confidence to guide serious action without false certainty

---

## 7) Cross-Domain Applicability

Stage 3 applies to:

- mental health inventions
- AI research / alignment
- technical systems and architectures
- novel methodologies and tools
- entrepreneurial projects

Especially where:

- the work is unconventional
- the creator is under-resourced
- the cost of abandonment is high
- validation pathways are slow, noisy, or hostile

---

## Tone & framing requirements

Stage 3 should be written and executed as:

- precise
- unapologetically pragmatic
- pressure-aware
- non-paternalistic
- oriented toward harm minimization through accurate calibration (not generic restraint)
