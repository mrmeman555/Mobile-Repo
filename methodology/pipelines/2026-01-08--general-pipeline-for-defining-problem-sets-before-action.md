# Note: General Pipeline for Defining Problem Sets Before Action

Date: 2026-01-08

Reusable, general-purpose pipeline for defining problem sets before creation or solution work, designed to prevent premature action, reduce bias, preserve optionality, and maximize leverage across domains.


---

## Purpose

This pipeline formalizes how to determine what problems need to be solved before attempting to create something or execute on a goal.

It is designed to:

- prevent premature action
- reduce bias
- preserve optionality
- maximize leverage by ensuring only the right problems are worked on


---

## Core Principle

> Execution quality is dominated by problem-definition quality.  
> Most failure comes not from poor effort, but from acting on the wrong problem abstraction.

This pipeline exists to reliably identify:

- what must be known before action is rational
- what can be deferred
- what decisions should remain flexible
- what information should be generated by research rather than intuition


---

## The Pipeline

### 1) Define the Objective Class (Not the Solution)

Do not ask “what should I do?” Instead, determine:

- What kind of outcome am I aiming for?
- What constraints matter (time, energy, independence, scalability, safety)?
- What upper bounds and lower bounds define success?

This establishes the decision context, not the decision itself.


### 2) Identify the Decision Bottleneck

Ask:

- What decision am I currently blocked on?
- What uncertainty is preventing confident action?
- What would need to be true for action to feel obvious?

This isolates the real problem: missing information, not motivation.


### 3) Enumerate Unknowns That Must Be Resolved

List categories of uncertainty, such as:

- demand / interest
- competition / saturation
- feasibility / cost
- leverage / scalability
- personal fit / sustainability
- downside risk / exit options

Do not answer these yet — only identify them.


### 4) Determine Which Unknowns Are Structurally Dependent

Some unknowns:

- must be resolved before others
- collapse multiple decisions at once
- meaningfully change strategy

Prioritize these. Everything else is downstream.


### 5) Translate Unknowns Into Researchable Questions

Convert uncertainty into explicit queries:

- questions that can be answered with data, synthesis, or analysis
- questions whose answers meaningfully reduce uncertainty

This turns ambiguity into a solvable system.


### 6) Use a Deep Research Method to Answer the Meta-Question

> “Given my objectives, constraints, and current position,  
> what information must be generated before choosing next actions?”

Crucially:

- even what research to do can be determined via deep research
- context for the research can itself be derived using the same method

This makes the process recursive, adaptive, and general-purpose.


### 7) Preserve Optionality Until Signal Emerges

No fixed prioritization ratios. No locked-in plans.

Instead:

- act once signal justifies commitment
- scale effort dynamically based on feedback
- allow multiple paths to remain viable

This replaces certainty-seeking with confidence-based adaptation.

## Why This Pipeline Is Powerful

- prevents wasted effort
- reduces emotional reactivity to uncertainty
- enables confident action without false certainty
- scales across domains
- turns intuition into structured inquiry
- makes complex decisions tractable


---

## Reusability

This pipeline can be applied to:

- content creation (e.g., YouTube MVPs)
- business strategy
- research direction
- learning plans
- systems design
- personal development
- problem-solving under uncertainty

Any time the question is:

> “What should I do next?”

This pipeline is the answer.

If you want, the next natural move would be to instantiate this pipeline for the YouTube/PoE project explicitly — but that instantiation should itself be the result of a deep research query.
