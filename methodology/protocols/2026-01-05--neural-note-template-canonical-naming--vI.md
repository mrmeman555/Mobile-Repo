Summary: Canonizes “Neural Note Template” as a mechanistically descriptive name for a note architecture aligned with neural encoding, weighting, retrieval, and reconsolidation, intended as the default structure for reconsolidation-relevant notes.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)

> The term “Neural Note Template” names a note architecture designed to mirror how the brain encodes, weights, retrieves, and reconsolidates information—making each note an intentional interface with neural processes rather than a passive record.

## Purpose

This artifact formally names and defines the **Neural Note Template** as the canonical structure used for all notes intended to:

- influence reconsolidation
- preserve epistemic fidelity
- stabilize confidence-weighted meaning
- support cross-temporal survival modeling

The name is not cosmetic; it is **mechanistically descriptive**.

## Why “Neural Note Template” Is the Correct Name

The template is explicitly designed to align with how neural systems operate:

- **Embeddings, not narratives**  
  Notes capture high-resolution embeddings rather than stories or summaries.

- **Confidence weighting, not facts**  
  Salience Nuclei encode what is granted predictive authority.

- **Latency and recency exploitation**  
  Dual-anchored nuclei leverage known neural salience effects at encoding and retrieval.

- **Reconsolidation-aware structure**  
  Capture is separated from synthesis to prevent state-dependent drift.

- **Survival-calculus alignment**  
  Notes explicitly encode impact on viability, which governs emotional weighting.

In short:  
The template does not store information *about* the mind.  
It is built to **interact with the mind on its own terms**.

## Defining Characteristics of a Neural Note

A Neural Note:

- Contains a **Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta)** at both beginning and end
- Separates **capture** from **interpretation**
- Preserves uncertainty without collapsing it
- Is robust to time, mood, and context shifts
- Is designed for **retrieval, not rereading**
- Functions as a **semantic contract**, not a diary entry

Each note is intended to behave like a stable neural trace.

## Why Alternative Names Fail

- *Journal entry* → narrative, state-dependent  
- *Insight note* → underspecified, content-focused  
- *Concept note* → abstract, not embodied  
- *Method note* → incomplete (only applies to some)

**Neural Note Template** correctly implies:
- embodiment
- weighting
- plasticity
- retrieval dynamics
- reconsolidation

No metaphor required.

---

## System-Level Implication

By naming the template explicitly, the system now has:

- a shared vocabulary
- a stable abstraction
- a reusable primitive
- a clear distinction between neural notes and other writing

This reduces ambiguity and prevents template drift.

---

## High-Compression Summary

The Neural Note Template is a note architecture explicitly designed to mirror neural encoding, salience, and reconsolidation dynamics, making each note an active participant in belief and survival-model updating.

## Salience Nucleus (Invariant Delta — Retrieval Copy)

> The term “Neural Note Template” names a note architecture designed to mirror how the brain encodes, weights, retrieves, and reconsolidates information—making each note an intentional interface with neural processes rather than a passive record.

---

## Status

The name **Neural Note Template** is now canonized as the default structure for all reconsolidation-relevant notes.

No further synthesis required.
