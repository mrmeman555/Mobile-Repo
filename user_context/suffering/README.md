# Suffering Ledger (Append-Only Evidence)

This folder stores append-only, factual accounting artifacts related to suffering magnitude, trauma cost, and related constraints.

- No interpretation beyond what the user explicitly states
- No therapeutic reframing, reassurance, or moralization
- No retroactive edits (write-once artifacts)
- This is accounting evidence, not narrative

---

## Storage model (two-layer)

### 1) Long-form suffering artifacts (individual files)
- Each suffering ledger entry you provide is stored as its **own Markdown file** in this folder.
- Content is stored **verbatim**, with **conversational wrapper removed** (keep only the ledger/note body).
- These files are **write-once**. If something must be corrected, create a new artifact that supersedes the old one.

**Filename format**
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS__<short-slug>.md`

### 2) Append-only index (`suffering_log.md`)
`suffering_log.md` is the **append-only chronological index** of the individual suffering artifacts.

Each index entry:
- is short (1–5 lines)
- is factual and concrete
- includes the **artifact filename** so the long-form evidence can be retrieved
- contains no motivational language and no abstraction
