# Cursor rules (user_context/suffering)

- Add new suffering ledger content as a **new file** in this folder (write-once).
- Strip any conversational wrapper/preface; store **only the artifact body**.
- Do not rewrite or “clean up” existing suffering artifacts.
- After adding a new artifact, append a pointer entry to `suffering_log.md`.
- Filename format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS__<short-slug>.md`
