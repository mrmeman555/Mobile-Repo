# Index (achievements)

This folder stores achievements as:

- **Long-form artifacts (individual files)**: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS__<short-slug>.md`
- **Append-only index**: `achievements_log.md`

`achievements_log.md` is the append-only, chronological index of the long-form achievement artifacts.

This file exists only to explain the storage model, not to summarize contents.
